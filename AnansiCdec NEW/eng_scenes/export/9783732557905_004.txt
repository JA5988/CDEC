Together they went into the kitchen. Carsten put the glasses in the dishwasher, for which there was just enough room, and turned it on. Marissa put the bowl with the remaining snacks in the cupboard. Then, hand in hand, they climbed the stairs to the second floor. As always, they first looked in the nursery to make sure Lilly was sound asleep. When they found the little girl's bed empty, it was not an uncommon sight for them. It had happened many times before. And of course they knew where their little daughter was. They walked over to the bedroom. "Oh, no!" Marissa giggled suppressedly as Carsten turned on the light and they saw the mess. In the middle of the bed lay Lilly, surrounded by countless dolls and stuffed animals, sleeping blissfully. She had even brought Oskar, her grizzly bear, who was twice her size. "My goodness, when did she drag all this over here?" Amused, Carsten shook his head. "When we sat in front of the TV and didn't notice anything. What are we going to do now? Sleep in Lilly's bed?" "You're forgetting the monster tree outside the window," Carsten reminded her with a grin. "Who knows what we'd see there in the night. Let's better carry our princess over and sleep in our own bed." Lilly didn't wake up as her dad gently lifted her out of the mountain of toys and carried her to the nursery. Marissa brought the giant bear after her. She shook the other toys off the comforter and onto the rug. Lilly could return those to her room herself tomorrow. "Can we finally get to the cozy part?" asked Marissa coquettishly as Carsten came back into the bedroom. "I'd love to, if you'll show me what you mean by that," he countered with an innocent grin.
