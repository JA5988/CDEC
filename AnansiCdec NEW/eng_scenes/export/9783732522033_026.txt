Thus the Easter Sunday evening had come. Countess Beate had been busy in the house with festive preparations and had not been seen all morning. In the meantime, the life-size portrait of Countess Alice ordered by Count Harro had arrived, packed in a large box. He had it unpacked and placed in the great hall for the time being. Leaning against a column, the picture stood in such a way that only the bright, light appearance of the young countess stood out in the weak lighting that prevailed here, as if she would have to step out of the frame at any moment. The portrait was absolutely true to life, a masterpiece. Lost in thought, Harro was standing in front of the painting when Griseldis came down the stairs with the comtesse. "Gilda - come here once." He led her in front of the painting. "Who is that?" Gilda clasped her little hands together. "Mama! Oh, Griseldis - come and see -, there is Mama's picture." "How good, Gilda, that now you can always look at this beautiful picture of your dear mamma. There you will never forget her, and you can go to her as often as you like," she said softly. There was a twitch in Harro's face. He wanted to say something, but gritted his teeth and walked away. Some bad memory must have gripped him. Griseldis took Gilda by the hand and also walked away with her.
