 After Griseldis had taken tea in Dalheim, she went back to Treuenfels. And she had a feeling as if this was her right home. When she arrived in Treuenfels, Gilda ran to meet her and embraced her. Count Harro looked after his little daughter as if he would have liked to do the same. "You must not be away from us so long again, Griseldis. We have been anxious for you, papa and I." Blushing, Griseldis looked into Count Harro's face. His eyes told her that Gilda had spoken truly. "Though I did not tell my little daughter in a word that it was so, she must have felt it out instinctively. I missed the sun in Treuenfels," he said softly. These words gave her a wonderful feeling of home. It warmed her heart that she had been missed. Griseldis now extended greetings to Count Harro and told him that the Baroness had asked her to bring Gilda to her once. "That can be done, of course, Fr√§ulein von Ronach. I will be grateful to the Baroness if she shows interest in my child."
