Unfortunately, his optimism was dampened the very next day when it turned out that neither he nor Marissa were suitable donors. Nor were Carsten's parents, who also had themselves tested. "You don't have any siblings, Mr. Phillips?" the attending asked. His parents' faces turned dismissive. "No, we only have the one son," Carsten's mother said quickly, before he could answer the question. Since Marissa's father was long dead and she had no siblings, the only one left was her mother, who lived in southern Germany. She was notified and asked to have a typing done at a hospital of her choice. Unfortunately, the news also came from there that her tissue characteristics did not match Lilly's. "So now what?" asked Marissa hopelessly when they got back home. She felt haunted by bad luck and was close to losing all courage again. "We'll just have to wait until a suitable donor is found through the donation bank," Carsten said. "It can't take that long. After all, it's not a donor heart or any other organ that has to meet strict criteria." Marissa chewed on her lip. A thought had occurred to her that she didn't dare say at first. But it was the last resort, the only hope. "Your parents lied when they said they had only one son," she said softly. Carsten avoided her gaze. "I know what you're getting at," he said heavily. "The thought has occurred to me myself. But it's hopeless to find Theo. Probably he has never returned from India." "Then all we can do is hope that an outside donor will be found soon, and that it won't be too late for our Lilly by then." Marissa barely managed to finish the sentence before she burst into new tears.
