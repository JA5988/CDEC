Duke Robert was not as unimaginative as his mother believed. Long since, the driving force behind all his actions was the desire to preserve the easy life that had fallen into his lap. He supported his mother's plans, but he also pursued his own unscrupulous goals. Kathleen and Patrick were to separate. This goal was particularly tempting to Duke Robert. For two reasons: He wanted to eliminate Kathleen as a future mistress at Windhome and win her over. So far, Duke Robert had had nothing but trouble with women. He lacked the sense for a tender romance. Wooing a woman was not in his nature. He wanted to possess a woman. He sought physical union alone. In this he had not been choosy until now. Since he had enough money, he thought all the more that every woman had to give herself to him immediately. He did not realize how much Kathleen and Patrick loved each other, because he himself was not capable of real love. So he didn't bother to attract Kathleen's attention first, he wanted to possess her and thought that afterwards she would be his property. As often as Kathleen was in the castle, he looked for an opportunity to be alone with her. He went to the manor hoping to achieve his goal there. But Kathleen was always near Patrick, even when he was supervising work in the fields. Gradually Robert became nervous. Patience was not one of his strong points anyway. He knew soon Kathleen's semester break would be over, and she would go back to Dublin to finish her medical studies.
