Rosemarie was now anxiously waiting for this alone time. Mrs. Ellen came to meet her more and more cordially and emphasized again and again how glad she was to have Rosemarie with her. "The longer I stay, the more difficult it is to get away from here," Rosemarie thought anxiously. She suffered from the unclear circumstances and longed to get away - although she was afraid of the uncertain future, and although she knew that the separation from Magnus would hurt her. She had no idea that her appearance had thrown Magnus Rittner into fierce struggles of the soul. He felt that since he had seen Rosemarie again, he loved her even more hotly and intimately than before. She seemed more lovable and charming to him. Her whole being had gained in maturity, her features were more thoroughly spiritual, and her smile had a sweeter, more melancholy charm. It spoke to his heart like a sweet, sad melody. And he knew he would never be able to drive that love from his heart. He began to ponder whether he was doomed to give up Rosemary's possessions without a fight, whether he should not try to win her over. He became even more uneasy when he noticed that Rosemarie blushed under his gaze, that her hand trembled like a caged bird in his when he grasped it, and that her eyes lowered shyly in confusion when he looked at her. True, he did not want to believe that he was allowed to interpret these signs in his favor. He did not want to let the hope germinate in him that Rosemarie might love him, because he was afraid of disappointment. And yet, in secret excitement, he searched for these little signs. And he was afraid of the time when she would leave again. He could read the anxious question in her eyes: "Why won't you help me leave? But he could not decide to do anything that could have released her from her position, even if he had thought of a pretext.
