It wasn't until six months later that he met him. Robert was also at Windhome when Patrick came home for the first time since his mother died. Patrick was almost embarrassed by how much Robert cared for him. All the while, he complained about how stingy his mother was and how he could barely afford anything. And finally he pumped Patrick. But he just laughed it off and said, "Do you think I can throw money around? My father keeps me pretty short. I don't afford more than other students in Dublin." Robert looked at him, stunned. "And you put up with that? What do you do without money to show the others who you are?" "I don't want to show them that. I'm glad as hell they treat me like their own. I have very good friends in Dublin. I shall be sorry to leave them when I come home for good next year." "Next year? You'll only be twenty-three then, you want to be done with your studies already?" asked Robert. "Of course. That's what I set out to do, and I'll get there." "I'll see that I get a job around here, then at least I'll always be pretty close to Mother's cooking pots, and life won't be too expensive for me. Maybe she'll be a little more generous, too, if she's going to be Duchess Alice." Patrick looked at Robert in amazement. "Are you kidding?" "How would I come to that? This is a deadly serious matter, after all. Just don't pretend you don't know. I'm convinced that everything is clear between my mother and your father. They're probably just being old-fashioned and waiting out the year of mourning for your mother."
