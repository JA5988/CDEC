 Matt went lower and forced himself to prepare for landing. In a few moments, the vast airfield had to appear at Agartha's gates. Matt glanced at the radar and compass. They were close enough to see the airstrip, despite the adverse visibility. But there was nothing there. No field and no landing marks. Not even luminous markers! As calmly and routinely as possible, Matt reached for the radio. "Airship port Agartha, come in. This is Maddrax. I'm approaching the airfield from the southwest and requesting permission to land." Nothing. No response. Just blind static from the ether. "Is something wrong?" asked Patrem. Matt thought feverishly. What did this mean? What was he supposed to do? And how, if necessary, could he use this situation for himself and against the archivist? "I can't get an answer," Matt said forcibly, trying to stick to the truth. "Radio waves have limited range when transmitted through solid rock," he tried to qualify his answer with a few general facts. Agartha City is built deep into the mountain." But that didn't change the fact that at least the airfield should have been on the surface. Instead, Matt sighted some kind of ... circular crevice in the eternal ice? He narrowed his eyes. What on earth was that? As he continued the approach, extending the landing gear along the way, the realization hit him like a punch in the gut. That was a ring! Just like the plant wall around the parallel world areas! A canyon with perpendicular walls and a diameter of about fifty kilometers cut out like with a wide laser beam! No doubt: Also Agartha had become a victim of a world exchange!
