When Patrick had already crossed the wide path that led along above the river, he stumbled and had trouble not to fall. A young red-haired woman in a reseda green veil robe lay huddled beside a shrub. He bent down to her and asked uncertainly, "Gwendolin?" The woman raised her arms. "Who are you?" Before Patrick could answer, she whispered, shivering, "Duke Patrick?" "Yes, Gwendolin." Patrick took her in his arms. "You're alive, you weren't in the pavilion?" He was already walking with her toward the little house by the river. "I've escaped. I'm looking for Emily. Did she drown in the river?" "Emily is with Stella. Nothing happened to her, she's alive. How do you know that a misfortune almost happened to her?" "A girl from the castle brought me coffee and told me that Emily was floating alone in a boat on the river." Gwendolin's voice grew quieter and quieter.
