After the conversation with the senior physician, they were allowed to briefly check on Lilly. Again they had to put on sterile green paper gowns including hood and mouth guard. This time Lilly was awake. She even smiled. Powerlessly, she waved her little hand. "Hello, Lilly-mouse." Marissa tried hard not to burst into tears in front of the child. Carsten also pretended to be emphatically cheerful. "How is our little princess today?" From feverishly shining eyes, Lilly looked at them. "Martians you are," she said, giggling. "Oh, sweetie!" Marissa was immensely pleased and relieved when the old Lilly came through again. Again, Carsten had to stop her from hugging the little girl. "I'm afraid we're not allowed to hug you and give you a kiss, as much as we'd like to," he explained to his little daughter. Lilly nodded in understanding. "Because if you do, you'll catch it from me and get pneumonia, too. Just get away from me."
