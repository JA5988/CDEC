 *** It took Duke Brian many days before he left the castle again. He looked aged by years, his face was grim. He knew that he had been able to prevent a trial of Patrick and the open scandal, but not that people were whispering behind his back. There were many who defended young Duke Patrick, who spoke of a conspiracy against him, but they were no match for the others. They stuck to their claim that Patrick had attacked and raped girls in the area. No one took Duke Roberts' name in vain. It was like a collusion. Duchess Alice continued to build her plans. She had now become certain that she would achieve her ultimate goal of seizing the entire property of the Youngs of Windhome. Patrick was gone. She had to make the most of the time. Her husband was to make a will in Robert's favor. And Robert had to marry. That was the condition she had set for him. Even if he was little pleased by it, he would fulfill it. He had learned to submit to her wishes and to believe all her resolutions to be right. Once there was a young duchess in the castle, Robert would refrain from going after other girls. The couple should have children as soon as possible. That would distract Duke Brian from thoughts of Patrick and show him that there was new life at Windhome. Three months after Patrick's elopement, Duke Robert's wedding took place at the castle. No one learned where he had met his wife. The only thing that got around was that she came from Connemara, the poorest region of Ireland, and had been a weaver. The fact that Duke Robert took this girl as his wife spoke for a love match. This won him many sympathies in the area. The young beautiful Duchess Gwendolin was admired, everyone hoped that she would break Duchess Alice's hard regiment. The old duke was also very impressed by Gwendolin. He gave Robert credit for choosing this girl.
