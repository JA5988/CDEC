Hardly anyone knew about this love story, which had taken place entirely in secret. For while her friends had spent the summer and fall in fashionable places on the Mediterranean, she, Leonie, had stayed at the castle. Socially, she would not have been a success anyway, since she was always measured against her beautiful half-sister Alessandra. Alessandra belonged in those glamour circles where one flew to Rome for a fashion show or considered it the greatest good fortune to be invited aboard for a gala dinner by a Greek shipowner. But she, Leonie, the younger princess, had not even known what she was supposed to do in these elite circles. Quietly and just as contentedly, she had made herself useful in and around the castle. She had opened kindergartens and visited the hospitals that were financially supported by the prince. She had also enjoyed visiting an old lady in her villa on the outskirts of town, a baroness of French descent. Leonie had brought books to Celine de Fornac and read to her since the old lady's eyes had noticeably deteriorated. For Leonie, the scene was like something out of a movie, when on a bright September afternoon an exceedingly handsome man had approached her through the front garden and introduced himself as the Baroness's nephew. Of course, she had recognized Julien de Sablemer right away, after all, enough pictures of him had gone through the press, but the personal impression - or so she thought - was far more overwhelming. She had slumped over in embarrassment and must have behaved like a provincial chicken. The baroness had then introduced them to each other and informed Leonie that this divine nephew dropped in on her from time to time. How often had Leonie looked out for the silver sports car since that day. For anyone coming from the highway crossed the long beech avenue to the castle, since the prince had allowed the road to be built through his grounds in the interest of the general public.
