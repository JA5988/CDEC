Marissa Phillips smiled expectantly when she heard her husband coming up the stairs. Carsten had finally been able to tear himself away from the computer. It was already late, but she was looking forward to a few tender minutes in his arms. Quietly the door was opened and closed again. Just as quiet were the footsteps that came to the bed. Then the bedspread was flung open beside her. The mattress made a soft sound as it was pressed down by Carsten's powerful body. Marissa noticed how he rolled to the side and turned to face her. Her smile deepened. Carsten wanted to see if she was asleep yet. Well, she wasn't going to let him fidget. With a comforting sound, she moved closer. "Glad you're here," she murmured, kissing him where she suspected his mouth was. He kissed her back. "Glad you're not asleep yet," he murmured darkly. Marissa snuggled up to him. "Now we can finally get to the cozy part." "Still now?" he pretended to be astonished. "Do you know what time it is?" "No. And I don't even want to know." Marissa laughed softly. "It's never been too late, has it?" "Hmm, you're right." Carsten let his hand slide over her bare arm. Slowly, he slid the strap of her nightgown over her shoulder. Happily, Marissa felt his tender fingers on her body. They had been married almost five years now, and they were still as happy as the first day. There was still quite a sizzle between them, too. Of course, they also had their problems. But Marissa didn't want to think about that now. Her hands did not remain idle either. Research she let her fingers wander down over Carsten's hairy chest, accompanied by his pleasurable growl.
