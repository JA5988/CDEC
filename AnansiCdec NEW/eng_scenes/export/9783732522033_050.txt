So from that hour Griseldis possessed the tower key for her exclusive use. And she spent every day the time in the tower when Gilda had her noon rest. It had settled in her mind that the mirror and the embroidered tapestry formed secret doors to the cavities under the closet, and that in this way a connection must be established between the tower rooms and her and the countess's bedroom.

Daily she struggled, alternating up and down, to find the right dolphin. Every day she began her game anew.
