"Up ahead," Collins said suddenly. "It's starting." It wasn't the first time Jeffrey Holder had seen a timequake, but the phenomenon was so strange that it had lost none of its fascination so far. Involuntarily, he held his breath. An area a good two hundred meters in diameter began to flicker all at once, as if it were hidden behind a gigantic curtain of billowing heat. All contours became blurred and blurred like a mirage. A blanket of tiny flickering and darting points of light seemed to settle over the desert. It seemed to Holder as if everything was happening in slow motion, although the entire process took only a few seconds. The outlines of the sand hills and the isolated boulders lying around became more and more blurred, dissolved in the flickering. At the same time, something new emerged out of nowhere. The huge plants could still only be guessed at, but with every second they became clearer. The flickering subsided, the shimmering points of light also became fewer and finally disappeared completely. DINO-LAND had grown a bit again. A dense primeval jungle of ferns, ginkgos, horsetails, cycads and conifers stretched out where only a few seconds ago there had been nothing but barren desert. Noisily, Jeffrey Holder expelled the air. During the first time, they had still had all the predicted time earthquakes monitored from the air, but finally renounced it. Twice helicopters had come within the sphere of influence and disappeared. Surveillance of the remaining border strips had taken priority, and it was little more than coincidence that their helicopter had just been in the vicinity. Collins pulled the aircraft around and flew over the newly added patch of jungle. He and Holder saw the animal at the same moment.
