Michael did not object, and soon they reached the T. Rex Hotel, where Betty had stayed. It was the largest - and probably the most expensive - hotel in town, but even its magnificent interior could not hide the fact that it had been built mainly of prefabricated elements in lightweight construction. Most of the walls gave the impression that you could easily punch through them with your fist. A lot of other things seemed improvised as well. After all, the hotel had not been built to last forever. On the contrary, no one knew exactly how long all of Henderson would exist, especially since DINO-LAND was constantly expanding. In a few years at the latest, the time quakes would also engulf the small town. Until then, they wanted to cash in heavily without having to invest more. "Why don't you go ahead to the restaurant," Betty asked. "I just want to go to my room and change." She smiled at him, got her key from the front desk, and walked over to the elevator.
