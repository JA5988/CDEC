What a bummer! Lorena had great difficulty coming to terms with her fate. Of course, she was aware that she could have suffered far worse injuries. Nevertheless ... did this really have to happen to her? In the run-up to Christmas, of all times, when she not only had her obligations at the Rheintaler Puppenb√ºhne, but also private engagements? She sighed deeply. Fortunately, she didn't need surgery. Nevertheless, they wanted to keep her in the hospital for a while to rule out consequential damage to her heart and lungs one hundred percent. I hope I'll be back on my feet soon," Lorena wished. For the puppet shows that were coming up in the near future, she would have to find someone to fill in for her. First thing in the morning, she was going to take care of that. Tonight, the phone calls were too much for her. Every breath pained her, and she found talking very tiring as well. Lorena closed her eyes and tried to put the horror of the accident out of her mind - the squeal of tires, the piercing horn, the hard thud against her bike, and the impact as she crashed to the curb. Her palms burned like fire, as did her right cheek. When she fell, she had automatically thrust her hands forward to spare her face. Nevertheless, she seemed to have suffered abrasions on her cheek. In her mind's eye a man in a leather hat appeared, who came tumbling out of his car with a horrified expression. After that, she must have been out of it for a while, because her memory did not return until she had been examined by Dr. Bergen, the emergency physician. There, the man had also been there again - or still. Lorena could still clearly see his face in front of her. She had to admit that he had left a deep impression on her, even if it had been he to whom she had owed her misery. Or no - hadn't he said that it hadn't been his fault?
