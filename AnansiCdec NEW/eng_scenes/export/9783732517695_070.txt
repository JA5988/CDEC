It was not until they walked along the river that evening that they spoke of their future. Kathleen was in great anxiety as to whether Duke Brian would prevail this time. But Patrick kept saying, "I know my father, when he is as determined as he is now, he acts. He himself must have had bitter experiences with his second wife, he has become an old man. It hurt me to have to see him like this. You will have to replace Gwendolin for him, he is very attached to her. I am also convinced that he will spare Robert for Gwendolin's sake." Kathleen had become very thoughtful. "I can't be as confident as you yet, Patrick. Your father may feel stronger than he is. Think about what his wife was able to accomplish. She was able to take your father's confidence away from you. She will never give up." Patrick was dismayed by Kathleen's doubts. Once again, it had a depressing effect on him that she so often let the cool mind speak where he listened only to the voice of his heart. He took her in his arms and covered her face with kisses. "I love you, Kathleen, so I can only be confident. We are promised to each other, our future together must finally come true. You don't know how I have longed for you. Now there is no room in me for misgivings. Will you stay in Cork and visit me again while I must remain hidden?" "Yes, Patrick. I will stay in Cork. Tomorrow we'll meet again at the river. I'll dream of you all night." Tenderly, Kathleen stroked his face. "The vow of love has reunited us, Patrick. As soon as everyone can know you're home again, we plan to ride to the Tower of Blarney."
