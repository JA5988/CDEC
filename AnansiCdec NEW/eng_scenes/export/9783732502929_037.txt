So one day passed after the other. Fortunately, Countess Rosenberg, as a rich heiress, often received visits from her relatives. Among them were also young, funny gentlemen who brought a lot of life into the quiet castle. All these people were very nice and kind to Rosemarie. Especially a niece of the Countess, Mrs. Loni von Schwarzburg, became more and more friendly to her aunt's companion. She was a born Comtesse Rosenberg, the daughter of a cousin of the Countess. Her husband was fighting in the West, and the young woman therefore came to Alteichen Castle more often than usual. Although she lived in constant worry about her husband, she bravely took her heart in both hands and appeared cheerful and merry. The better she got to know Rosemarie during her visits, the more cordially she met her. Years went by in this way. Outside the war was raging, but in Alteichen Castle not much was noticed. The Countess only regretted time and again that she could no longer go on trips, as she had done every year before the war. However, Rosemarie was basically very happy about this, because she thought with horror that she would have had to perform chambermaid and nurse duties again while traveling. She preferred to sit over sewing.
