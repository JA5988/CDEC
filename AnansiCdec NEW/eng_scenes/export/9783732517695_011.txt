Only after two weeks was Patrick so healthy that he could have resumed his duties as a shepherd. When he wanted to do so, he was turned away. The man who was only supposed to substitute for him was to remain a shepherd. Patrick was very upset when he learned this. He took this action as a distrust against him. He also knew how difficult it would be to find a new job. In the few weeks he had worked as a shepherd, it had only been possible to put aside a nest egg because of Stella's salary. But this would soon be used up. They had to consider themselves lucky that they were allowed to continue living in the small house by the river.
