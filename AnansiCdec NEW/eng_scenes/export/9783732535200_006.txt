It had now been almost two years since a Tyrannosaurus, which had come to the present with one of the first DINO-LAND areas, had wiped out his family. His wife Helen and daughter Sandy had been killed by the beast. Sandy's twin sister Tippy had fallen into a coma-like, catatonic state as a result of the shock she had suffered. Since then, she had been in the hospital, no longer aware of anything that was happening around her, and had to be fed intravenously. Her brain activity had dropped to a barely measurable minimum, and she had not yet died only because she was being kept alive artificially by machines. Since that fateful day, Boris Corman's life had been dictated only by thoughts of revenge. At Tippy's bedside in the hospital, he had sworn this revenge, and it had become his driving force, his only mission in life. It was all he could still do for his wife and daughters. The T. Rex that had caused the carnage was long dead, but Corman wanted to make sure that never again could people fall victim to one of these beasts. He was a biochemist, and this profession was the only possible way for him to carry out his revenge. He had succeeded in stealing the eggs of the Compsognathus' unnoticed from the laboratory where he worked and hatching them here. Since then he experimented with the animals. In long, devoted research work, he had developed a serum that worked specifically on dinosaurs and made the males infertile - at least that was what it was supposed to do in theory.
