Outside the door, footsteps and voices could be heard. Lorena involuntarily held her breath. Would Theo come to visit her again? Theo ... A smile flitted across her face. She had spontaneously fallen in love with this adorable, handsome, funny and charming guy. At the thought that he might walk in the door any minute, her stomach began to tingle with excitement. She lay back down and pulled up the covers. Had her accident been a twist of fate? In the meantime, Theo had come by several times and pampered her with flowers, fruit and sweets. He didn't even live in town, but had to drive quite a distance to visit her. I wonder if he feels the same way about me," Lorena asked herself. She thought she sensed that he also had strong feelings for her. Otherwise, would he make the long drive? It is his guilt that drives him, an inner voice said. But Lorena shook her head. No, she had finally talked him out of them. Why should he continue to feel guilty when it hadn't been his fault that he had hit her? The voices could still be heard outside her door, but the male voice did not sound like Theo. Now the two people seemed to be separating.
