 "You're risking a lot for people you don't even know," Aruula said, as they now flew full thrust back to Rome. "Because I have a conscience that just won't stay still," Matt said, grinning wryly. Aruula looked him over from the side, and Matt once again felt gratitude to have a companion like her. Especially since he had thought he had lost her once before that day. "You know you're also saving those who tried to kill us?" she questioned further. "Because they didn't know any better," Matt countered. Aruula wrinkled her nose; an unmistakable sign that she was not satisfied with the answer. "Seriously, Maddrax, how are we going to do that? Suppose we manage to prevent the catastrophe. What then? Are you just going to let these people loose on our world?" "They deserve the same odds as the savage Hydrites," Matt replied, looking back out the cockpit window, outside of which the coast off Rome was bound to appear any minute. "Just because the Hydrites were the victims and the humans the perpetrators in their world doesn't mean they're any less dangerous. Or that the humans are the more aggressive species. It's much more about how they will adapt in our world." "That sounds like an experiment," Aruula returned. "Do you want to take responsibility for it if it goes wrong?" Matt sighed. "At least I don't want to take it for everyone dying." Aruula took a breath for a retort, but then just exhaled audibly and leaned back in her seat. He knew she was only in it for him. Not because she shared his views every time, but because she stood by him, for better or worse. The parallel world area came into view as the on-board chronograph showed fourteen minutes remaining. It was going to be damn close! Matt steered the glider over the thorn wall and then went lower to see better. The tachyon waves could now be located permanently. As calculated, their starting point was exactly where Patrem had let him land to manipulate the time stopper.
