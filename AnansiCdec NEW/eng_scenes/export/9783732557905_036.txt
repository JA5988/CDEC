In fact, Lilly was feeling really bad today. But she didn't want to let that show. She didn't want to go home, she wanted to play in the store. So she suppressed the coughing that kept coming up as best she could. And she didn't cry when it hurt in her chest as if under a knife when she breathed. Of course, Lilly didn't stay in her play corner in the office. After lunch, most of which she didn't down because she was so nauseous, she went back to wandering. In the sales rooms she was distracted by the beautiful toys and the many people; then it wasn't so bad with the cough and the sore throat and the earache. Only the many pustules she had on her chest itched terribly. Mom hadn't even seen them yet, because Lilly had dressed herself that morning. With her Santa hat on, she wandered around the store. She beamed when someone made a remark about the "cute kid." She would have loved to sing a Christmas carol, but her throat hurt too much. And also the breathing. Again and again she looked out for the nice woman and the girl with whom she had played so beautifully. They had said that they would come back soon. Why didn't they come? Lilly was getting tired. There was a mattress in Grandma's office where she sometimes took her afternoon nap. I wonder if she should rest there for a while, even if it was boring. Her eyes fell on the big glass store door. Outside, people walked by with full bags and purses.
