Stella had not been back to the castle lately. But now she went up again, although Patrick disapproved. She was startled to see little Emily standing across from her. She was pale. "Are you sure you'll come to see me every day again, Stella?" she asked skeptically. "Yes." Stella wrapped the girl in her arms. That's when Emily began to cry. "Grandmother used to lock me in my room," she complained. "But why?" asked Stella. "She didn't do that before, did she?" "Because I went to my mommy in the gazebo," Emily confessed. "You didn't come to the castle anymore, but I want to love someone. And mommy was so happy." Now Emily reached out and pulled Stella's head down enough to whisper in her ear. "You can't tell on us, Stella. My mommy said she wanted to run far away with me. To where she was at home. I've forgotten what it's called." "To Connemara?" asked Stella. "Yes. And she says that's where we'd hide so father and grandmother wouldn't find us, but we'd always be together." "You really mustn't tell anyone, Emily." Stella tried hard not to show the child how frightened she was. "After all, I didn't tell Grandma, Stella. She kept wanting to know what I talked to my mommy about." Emily wiped away her tears and made a defiant face. "I didn't tell Grandma, even though she wanted to lock me in the basement." Stella had a lot of trouble distracting the little girl. She resolved to go to the pavilion as soon as possible and warn Gwendolin of her plan. He could only be her undoing and make little Emily even more miserable. Never would Gwendolin succeed in getting as far as Connemara with the child. How desperate must the young mother have been to dare so much?
