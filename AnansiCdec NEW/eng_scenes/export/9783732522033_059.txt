She lay like that for a while until the opening and closing of a door reached her ear. It was the door that led to Griseldis' room. Beate heard a light step hurrying past her door. It was Griseldis' step. She knew it. Like an animal, she crept toward the door. Quietly she opened the door and peered out. Just then she saw Griseldis disappear on the stairs. She stepped to the window. Down there she went, the blond witch. She went over to the tower. What was she always doing there? She was rarely seen on the balcony. When Griseldis disappeared into the tower, Beate pulled herself together and followed her.
