He needed to calm down so he didn't do anything rash. Corman let himself sink into an armchair. To distract himself, he turned on the television. Without much interest, he zapped through the programs until a report on the CNN news channel suddenly caught his attention. It was about DINO-LAND and what would happen to Las Vegas, which had been swallowed up by the primeval jungle two years ago. Corman only got the last part of the message, so he didn't really understand the overall context. Therefore, he kept the channel tuned and waited for the report to be repeated. He had to be patient for half an hour, but it was worth the wait. Alleged evidence was reported that the vanished lands were not destroyed and the missing people were not necessarily dead, but that there had been an exchange between the past and the present that continued with each successive timequake. Excited, Corman jumped up and turned off the television. The pain in his leg was forgotten. Thoughts were racing through his head. The news opened up a whole new perspective for him. Until now he had assumed that he could only make the dinosaurs infertile with his serum and thus condemn them to extinction, which were in DINO-LAND. Now, however, there was a possibility for him to take revenge on all dinosaurs. At all the beasts which had lived millions of years ago! There existed a way into the primeval time of the earth, and he would set everything to tread this way!
