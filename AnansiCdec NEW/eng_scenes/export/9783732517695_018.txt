Little Emily was very sad. Once again she had to do without Stella. She could not understand it. Although her grandmother had strictly forbidden her to leave the terrain around the castle, Emily ran down to the little house by the river. But she stood in front of a locked door. She went to the windows, stood on tiptoe, and pressed her nose against the panes. Now she could see inside the house, but she didn't spot Stella anywhere. It wasn't until the castellan told Emily that Stella had stayed in Cork. "Why is Patrick sick again?" asked Emily. The castellan said that Patrick had had an accident at Windhome Manor, but that he would soon be released from the hospital. This was now Emily's great hope. Every day she found an opportunity to run down to the river and make sure that Stella had not returned. But each time Emily came back to old Graham dejected, saying, "She's not home yet. I don't think Stella is coming back at all." The castellan felt very sorry for the child, but he could not help her. And he knew Emily would have to face an even greater disappointment. He had heard from Duke Robert that they intended to dispense with Stella's services in the castle in the future. The duke had acted as if that was his mother's decision and as if he thought it was right, but the castellan suspected that Stella didn't want to come anymore. He had good reason to do so. He believed the rumor that had been going around since Patrick's fall into the silo. There were people on the estate who claimed Patrick had been pushed into the silo. And it was by a man who had worked on the estate for only a few hours. No one knew his name, but they wanted to have seen him with Duke Robert. The castellan did not have the heart to tell Emily that Stella would not be coming back to the castle. It was left to Stella to teach Emily herself.
