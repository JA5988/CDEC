Mrs. Ellen said one morning at breakfast, which she took alone with her husband: "You or Magnus could probably show Fr√§ulein von Salten around the factory. I promised her, and she seems to be very interested in it." Rosemarie had let this interest slip in the hope that she could use this opportunity to bring about a solitude with Magnus. That Fred would not guide her, she took for granted. And in this she had not been mistaken. Fred immediately replied to his wife, "Magnus can do that. He can explain everything to her much better. After all, my department is only the laboratory." "Very well, then I will ask Magnus to do it," Mrs. Ellen replied. She also told Rosemarie that her brother-in-law Magnus would now show her around the plant as soon as possible. It had not been possible so far because of the business visit.
