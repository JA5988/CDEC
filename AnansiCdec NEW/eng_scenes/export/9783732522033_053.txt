 When she entered the castle hall, she almost cried out in terror. At the door she met the countess. She looked at her sharply and inquiringly. "Where have you come from so early? Have you been out?" If the Comtesse had always seemed sinister and suspicious to her, now she seemed ghastly and terrible. "I was out for a bit-I had a headache," she stammered, hurrying past the comtesse up the stairs. Gilda, fortunately, was still asleep. So she had another quarter of an hour to herself to compose herself and calm down. Powerless, she sank into an armchair and folded her hands in her lap. "Father in heaven! Father in heaven - help me! What shall I do now, how to finish the work I have begun?" So she sat for a while, letting her thoughts chase. And then she jumped up and closed the door. She took out the ring, looked at it closely. The rubies shimmered like red drops of blood. She placed the ring in a small box and put it in the neckline of her dress. Here it was safe for the time being, until she was clear with herself what she should do. Then she turned and looked at the picture that closed off the closet. What if disaster came to her the same way it came to Countess Alice? Beate hated her as she had hated the Countess. For a long time she did not let herself be depressed by such a fearful mood. I must go forward on the path once trodden, and I will. Count Harro's happiness and peace of mind are more important to me than anything else - more than my life, she thought. The thought gave her courage.
