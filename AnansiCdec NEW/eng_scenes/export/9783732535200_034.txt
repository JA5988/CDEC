    US Highway 95 seemed to stretch like a dead straight line in a northwesterly direction through the desert. On the map, it described numerous kinks and bends, but this was only clearly visible due to the reduced scale. If one drove along it, the windings were so extremely long that one hardly noticed them. The sun blazed down as a glaring fireball from an intensely blue sky, in which not even the smallest cloud was to be discovered, which promised relief from the scorching heat. Billowing heat rose from the asphalt, blurring everything more than half a mile away as if behind a curtain of water.
