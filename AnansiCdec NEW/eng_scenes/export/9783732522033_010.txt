 Chatting happily, Gilda later skipped along beside her father. She was happy to have him back and not to have to stay at home with Beate. She did not like Beate very much. She tried very hard to win her favor. But children have a fine ear for true feelings, and Gilda perhaps instinctively realized that Beate did not genuinely feel for her. So father and daughter made good progress. They encountered no one but a few woodsmen, who greeted the Count shyly and hurried past him. But when they arrived at a crossroads, they saw a horseman. Harro stopped and looked toward him. He recognized his friend, Baron Dalheim, who had had to testify against him in his trial. For Beate had failed her testimony, and so only the Baron knew that he had possessed the poison. Count Harro looked at his friend with staring eyes. What would he do? Would he reach out to him or not? Baron Dalheim had also caught sight of father and daughter. A bright red flashed over his handsome, open face. His eyes looked undecided for a moment. But then he suddenly turned his gaze sideways and gave the appearance that he had not noticed father and daughter. With a light squeeze of the reins, he steered his horse across into the forest and rode quickly away. Harro turned deathly pale. He knew very well that Baron Dalheim had cut him on purpose. And he had to let it pass without defense, was not allowed to demand accountability. Every one of his peers was allowed to treat him with such disrespect with impunity. And if Fritz Dalheim did so, then the others would certainly do the same. And he still had to swallow some bitterness. On the way back, he walked through the village with Gilda. People stood there and stared at him like a wild animal. Or they ran away and hid in their houses behind the windows to stare at him curiously. He now knew what it was like to run gauntlets.
