One evening Patrick was sitting on the terrace in front of his bungalow. Wind came up unexpectedly, making it uncomfortable to stay outside any longer. But Patrick was not drawn indoors. Hours spent feeling the wind usually made him fall off the wagon. Then he thought of Windhome. And of the superstitions that had taken root there in connection with rising wind. Wind that becomes a storm meant impending disaster in the castle. Even when his father was killed in an accident. Patrick could not bear this thought. He jumped up, ran to the outbuildings of the bungalow and got his horse from the stable. He rode out into the bright night, across the expanse of land, with no destination in mind. All his thoughts were on Windhome.
