 She went straight to Count Harro. He had told her that he was expecting her because he had something to discuss with her. He knew that he was now facing a very unpleasant scene. "You wished to speak to me, Harro?" "Yes, Beate. Please, sit down. You look very suffering." "Don't do that - let's not talk about it." "Yes we are, Beate. I am in serious concern for you. That's why I want to make you a suggestion. The stay in Treuenfels is not good for you. That's why I want to help you change it for another one. You shall create a new home for yourself wherever you like. I will gladly direct a larger sum to you for this purpose and have a reasonable annual pension paid to you." Then she suddenly sank out of her chair at his feet and dug her wincing face into his hand. "Harro - Harro - have mercy - I - I love you - and I perish in that love." He picked her up and gently but forcefully broke away when she tried to cling to him. "I have guessed it, Beate, and have deeply pitied you. But that is precisely why it is necessary for you to go. Poor Beate - go to your room now, calm down and consider my words. And then, when you have made a decision, let me know." She straightened up and looked at him as the condemned man looks at his executioner. Her lips moved as if she wanted to say something more. And at last she turned away and went out without another word. Staring straight ahead, she went into her rooms and groaned like a wounded animal.
