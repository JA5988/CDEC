Rosemarie von Salten was here in the company of her mother, and Fred Rittner was in the company of his brother, who was several years older than him and with whom he had undertaken a major trip. He wanted to recover from the strain of his doctoral exam, and his brother Magnus had taken some time off from his business to be able to accompany him. The brothers loved each other very much. Magnus Rittner had become head of the large Rittner paint works after the death of his father, and Fred had studied chemistry in order to be able to devote his energy equally to the work. Although the brothers loved each other warmly, they were of very different characters. Magnus was a serious, reliable man who made high demands on himself and others. Fred Rittner was more light-blooded, he loved the joyful enjoyment of life, unscrupulously took all the good and pleasant things that life offered him, without being particularly concerned with serious duties. More amiable than his serious brother, all hearts flew to him, and he accepted it with a sunny victoriousness, as if it could not be otherwise. Rosemarie von Salten, with fine instinct, had immediately recognized in Magnus Rittner the more valuable. She looked up to him in shy admiration, but did not dare to believe that he could ever have any interest in her. At first, of course, he met her with a strangely gentle courtesy that touched her strangely. But then the closer she got to know him, the more reserved he became toward her. Fred Rittner was at first dear and sympathetic to her only because he was Magnus' brother. In order to be able to stay near him a lot, she put up with Fred's company.
