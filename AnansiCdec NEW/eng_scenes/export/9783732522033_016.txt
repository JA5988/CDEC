 Griseldis brought sunshine into the quiet, gray house. It was as if the old ladies remembered their own youth, when they had sailed out into life with full sails and secret expectation. And this young girl awakened in them the consciousness that they basically led an enviable life here in the convent. Mother Anna saw with amazement and admiration the blessing that radiated from this young girl to her whole little flock. She felt it not least in herself, for while the terrible drama had been going on in Treuenfels Castle, she had been agitated, the worry about Count Harro's fate oppressing her heart. And because she could not bear this burden on her soul alone, she initiated Griseldis von Ronach into all her sorrows. What Mother Anna would not have discussed with any of her abbey ladies, she confided to Griseldis. Thus, through Mother Anna's reports, the young lady got to know all the people who lived and had lived in Treuenfels. She also showed Griseldis the photographs of these people. So she saw in the picture Count Harro Treuenfels, his beautiful wife, his little daughter and the Count's mother. Mother Anna had no picture of Comtesse Beate, and the old lady spoke of Beate only very briefly. Griseldis became absorbed in the noble features of the Count, while Mother Anna gave her an account of his character and related some episodes that illustrated his great kindness of heart and strict truthfulness and honorableness. And the young girl's heart spoke for the man accused of such grave guilt. No, this could not be a murderer. She fevered like the old lady in anticipation of the trial, and read with burning eagerness every word that was in the papers about the matter. In the meantime, the greater part of the hundred days that Griseldis had been allowed to spend in the convent had passed. And the nuns and Mother Anna looked forward to the end of those days with great sadness.
