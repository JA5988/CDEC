 - First, Count Harro went up to Beate. A servant and a maid accompanied him at his command. Again he knocked on the door, this time very loudly and energetically. But no answer came from the room. Harro had almost expected it. Now he beckoned the servant and ordered him to unscrew the handle from the door. Thus the door was opened. Harro switched on the electric light. And there he saw Beate sprawled on the carpet, her hand still tightly clasped around his picture, which she held pressed against her. He bent down to her, startled, and saw the bluish lips and the strangely closed eyelids. He knew then that she had judged herself. "She is dead," he said hoarsely. It was as if an invisible messenger had carried this news throughout the castle. The people all came up and crowded to the door. Count Harro had seized a letter that had been lying on the desk. To my cousin, Count Harro Treuenfels. He took it, then went to the door and drove the people away. "Everything must remain here as it is," he said, and commanded the servant Heinrich, since the door could not be closed, to stand guard in front of it so that no one would go in.
