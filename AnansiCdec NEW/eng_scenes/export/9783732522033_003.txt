And now he stood among his subordinates - an outcast, a dishonorable one in the eyes of the world. He saw that his people did not believe in his innocence either, and this made his heart cramp as he faced them. Without speaking a word, he saluted briefly and walked through the rows near the stairs at the back of the hall. Pale was his countenance, in his eyes was an expression of anguish. Still standing at the stairs was Mademoiselle Perdunoir, his daughter's governess, looking at him with horrified eyes. And when he now approached her with his gloomy burning gaze, she drew back from him, shrieking. Count Harro winced slightly. "You will leave Castle Treuenfels tomorrow morning, Mademoiselle. I want to give my daughter a German governess." And now the count straightened up. In a raised, firm voice he said calmly, "I keep no one in my service. Whoever wishes to leave Treuenfels Castle shall do so without hindrance. I hereby cancel all contracts and allow everyone to leave immediately. Those who do not wish to stay will receive a quarter of a year's salary at the Rentamt." With that, he turned back to the stairs and wanted to climb up.
