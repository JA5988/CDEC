While she was still thinking about it, Dr. Andrea Bergen came into the room. "You're still awake, Mrs. Werding," she said, stepping up to her bedside. "How do you feel now?" "Catapulted out of my everyday life," Lorena replied with a grimace. "It's hard for me to come to terms with the fact that I have to lie here instead of doing my work. I'm a puppeteer and I have my permanent engagement with the Rheintaler Puppenb√ºhne." "Oh, really?" Andrea Bergen smiled in surprise. "Of course, we are all familiar with the well-known puppet stage." "In addition, I also perform under my own direction in retirement homes and other social institutions, in children's wards of hospitals as well. I have specialized in therapy puppetry, which is great fun for me." "It's certainly a rewarding job, too," the emergency room physician commented. "One of our pediatricians regularly does Punch and Judy shows for the kids in the pediatric ward. He always has great success with that." "A puppeteering pediatrician, how nice." Lorena smiled. "Have you been well taken care of?" inquired Dr. Bergen. "Is there anything else that can be done for you?" "The pain is pretty bad again. I can't sleep like this. Maybe if I could get another pill?" "I'll let the nurse's office know." The emergency physician wished her a pleasant night and went back out.
