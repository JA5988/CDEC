Griseldis did not have a long journey. She took the express train for about two hours to the town closest to Treuenfels. A servant in the dark gray livery of the count's house stood waiting on the platform. Griseldis recognized him by this, since Mother Anna had described them to her. Calmly and confidently she walked up to him. "You come from Treuenfels Castle, don't you?" The servant tipped his hat and looked critically scrutinizingly at the young lady's plain, dressy traveling suit. "Yes, gracious lady, I am to fetch Fr√§ulein von Ronach," he replied very politely under her calm, steady gaze. Griseldis nodded. "Please, lead me to the carriage." The servant showed her the way. She gave the servant her luggage ticket and took a seat in the carriage, whose flap the servant opened for her. Her suitcases were placed to the charioteer, and now the servant also took a seat next to the same. Some people had stopped. The Treuenfels livery was well known in the city. People were wondering who the beautiful young lady was who had been picked up. She made such a happy face. Griseldis had no idea what a headache she was giving people. When the car drove away, she would have liked to cheer loudly about the fast ride. At the same time, however, her heart was beating a little uneasily in her chest.
