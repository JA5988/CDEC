 It had become very late. With fleeting steps she hurried home. She was so happy that she had been able to do a service to the beloved man in silence and secrecy. When Griseldis came home, she found the child in the company of his father. She excused herself, still somewhat breathless from her fast run. "I had extended my walk too far, and unfortunately could not be back in time," she said. "You stayed an awfully long time, Griseldis! We want to go up to the tower after all," said Gilda, nestling close to her. "There's still time for that, Gilda." "I suggest we take tea quickly now and then climb the tower, Fr√§ulein von Ronach. For surely you still want to visit my wife's rooms in daylight, to compare them with your dream image," said the Count with quiet, good-natured mockery. "I think you are making fun of me, Count. But I don't mind if it gives you just a little pleasure."
