 When he woke up again, he was lying on a cot in the sickroom. The sovereign medic bent over him with a worried expression. "Have you been attacked, my Cesar?" But Aticus had no time to argue with him. "Where is the mystery master? I must see him. At once! Only he can heal me!" he squealed indignantly, straightening up as best he could. The medico recoiled and bowed deeply as a sign of his submission. "As far as I know, he was involved in the fight in the palace courtyard," he revealed his knowledge. "What fight?", Aticus inquired, irritated. "Why didn't I learn about it? Is he injured? Where is he?" "You'll have to ask the only superior about that. He has only just regained consciousness. But if I am to believe his words, your Mystery Master was not a victim, but ..." The medico faltered and paused. "What are you trying to say? What happened in the courtyard?", Aticus shouted at him, salivating. "The guard was talking about him turning into some kind of ... tentacled creature. A yellowish monstrosity with feelers instead of hair. It had this blond stranger with it and got into the flying vehicle with him." Aticus glared at the medikus and convulsed as another of those waves was felt. "What then?" he asked in a dragging voice when the moment had passed. "He ... he flew away, they say," Medikus replied, gasping. At least these energy jolts didn't seem to be imaginary, because everyone present reacted to them. After all, Aticus was now sure that it was all the Mystery Master's fault. Everything! And Patrem would pay for it! For having made a fool of him! Him, the Cesar of Rome and the whole world! Aticus roared at the top of his lungs. All his anger was discharged in that one cry. He screamed at the medico until he and everyone else had left the room.
