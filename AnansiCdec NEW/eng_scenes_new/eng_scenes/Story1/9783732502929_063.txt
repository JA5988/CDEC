When the two brothers rejoined the ladies for dinner, there was quite a lively tone at the table. Frau Ellen chatted cheerfully and laughingly told of the quirks of Countess Rosenberg, who counted every match to her servants and once dismissed a servant because he burned a bale of newsprint instead of selling it. Rosemarie also had a few episodes to share. Fred had already gotten over his dismay of this morning. He was very amused because so was his wife. Magnus Rittner, however, often let his gaze linger obliviously on Rosemary's face. A few times her eyes met his. And there he saw each time a quiet blush rise in her cheeks.
