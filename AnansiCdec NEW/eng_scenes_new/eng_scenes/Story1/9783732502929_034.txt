Bad weeks were now coming for Rosemarie. Her mistress made high demands on her strength and performance. In the mornings, she had her help her with the toilet, which often made Rosemarie feel physically uncomfortable. Then she had to read to her, take care of her correspondence, go for walks with her, and be around her all the time. If Rosemarie ever had an hour free when the Countess did not need her, then she had to do all kinds of sewing for her. In the evening she had to attend her night toilet and at night she often had to sleep on the divan in the countess's room when she felt unwell.
