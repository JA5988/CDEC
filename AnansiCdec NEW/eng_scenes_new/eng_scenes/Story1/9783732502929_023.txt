Punctually, the two ladies met in the vestibule and left the boarding house. Rosemarie carried the jewelry box in a plain brown leather bag, like those used by the thousands when traveling. It looked quite unobtrusive, and the Countess nodded with satisfaction. Rosemarie wanted to call a car, but the Countess held her back. "What's the use of a carriage? They are very expensive. You can save the money. We have only a few minutes to go. Or is the bag too heavy for you?" The young lady shook her head. "Oh no! I just didn't know if we had a long walk ahead of us, and I didn't want to subject you to the rigors of one." "A little promenade is very pleasant to me." Slowly they walked on, and the Countess leaned unabashedly on Rosemary's arm. Occasionally she stopped before a display and criticized the objects in the windows. Rosemarie patiently waited beside her.
