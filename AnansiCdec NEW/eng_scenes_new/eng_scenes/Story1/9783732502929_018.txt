She had to make a stop in Genoa. A longer stay was necessary. Frau von Salten took lodging with her daughter in a small boarding house, where the stay was cheaper than in a hotel.

She could give him hope that Rosemarie would accommodate his wishes. However, if she does not arrive within a fortnight, he may seek her out in Genoa.
