The two ladies held Rosemarie for another hour until the master of the house came home. Then Rosemarie said goodbye. She was delighted with her new mistress and thanked Frau von Schwarzburg warmly for arranging the match. The latter laughingly rebuffed. "Dear God, that is the least I could do for you. You really deserve to feel a little better now. For almost five years you have vegetated in old oaks like an enchanted Sleeping Beauty among loud old, morose people." With that, she kissed Rosemarie on the cheek and gave her another smiling nod. So Rosemarie drove back to Alteichen with a lighter heart. On the way, she remembered that she did not even know the name of her mistress. She only knew that she was a Baroness Reinsberg by birth.
