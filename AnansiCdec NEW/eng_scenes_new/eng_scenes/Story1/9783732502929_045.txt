It was a warm, sunny spring day - a Sunday. Magnus was sitting in his study in his villa. The window was wide open, letting the pure spring air flow into the room. Outside, it was holiday quiet. Only the birds were singing and rejoicing, as if they had to announce to the world that it was spring - and peace, a peace, of course, in which the peoples did not yet want to believe and which they disturbed themselves again by party hatred and strife. Magnus had read the newspaper news with a serious face. Now he bent over his books and papers. Among them was a bank statement. Magnus looked through the items carefully, and suddenly he bristled. We are notifying you that we have recognized you for giro transfer of the Gothaer Bank on behalf of Mrs. Maria von Salten with Mark 5000. Like a jolt, it went through his form. He picked up the sheet and stared at the place where Frau von Salten's name was written as if he could not believe his eyes. He had never expected that Frau von Salten would ever pay him back the five thousand marks. And now, after five years, she suddenly sent in this money. Had she perhaps come into better circumstances and now been able to pay off her debts? Had her daughter perhaps now made a brilliant match after all, allowing her to repay borrowed money? He put the paper back on the desk and stared down at it. And as if reborn by this news, the pain he had suffered for Rosemarie von Salten awoke again in his chest. He propped his head up in his hand and covered his burning eyes. Rosemarie! Rosemarie von Salten! Where are you? What has become of your fate? And it tore at his heart like a physical pain. Again he saw in his mind her fair, pure beauty before him. What a sweet magic that could only radiate from a pure heart! And this spell was still working on him now, after five years. "Rosemarie." As if in deep tenderness, the serious, silent man whispered this name. He sat motionless like that for a while, absorbed in deep remembrance.
