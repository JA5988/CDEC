Now came an eventful time for Germany. The armistice was followed by severe political unrest and upheaval - Germany became a republic. Even now, Alteichen Castle was far away from all unrest, but winter also weighed with strange heaviness on this quiet spot on earth. Countess Rosenberg was terribly upset because people all wanted to be equal, because all wanted to be masters and none wanted to be servants. She became more obnoxious day by day, no one could do anything right for her, and Rosemarie had bad days. The Countess began to ail and had to go to bed. The Countess's relatives also came to visit now, and after Christmas, Frau von Schwarzburg and her husband also registered. They wanted to come at the beginning of February for a few weeks. It was now 1919, and the spectre of hunger was looming over the countryside. Countess Rosenberg's condition became more and more precarious, but she did not think of dying. No one was allowed to utter that word near her.
