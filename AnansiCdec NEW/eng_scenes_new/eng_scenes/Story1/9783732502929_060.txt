The ladies chatted for another hour in Ellen's salon. Then the young woman said, "Now I'll send you to your room so you can unpack your things and make yourself at home. When you are ready, please report to me, and we can take another walk through the park. I must show you around a little, so that you will soon feel at home with us. You must also get to know the factory, it is very interesting. But one of the gentlemen will have to show you around and explain everything to you." Rosemarie rose. "I will hurry to finish quickly, madam." Ellen smiled mischievously. "I'm not a crunchy witch, Fräulein von Salten, take your time. I won't rush after you like the Countess Rosenberg did." Rosemarie forced herself to smile. "I'll have to get used to that." "That will be quick. So, goodbye, Fräulein von Salten, or may I call you Fräulein Rosemarie?" Rosemarie had to wonder how Frau Ellen would relate to her if she knew what had once been between her and her husband. She felt dishonest and false. But, of course, she couldn't help but allow Mrs. Ellen to address her that way. Quickly, then, she withdrew.
