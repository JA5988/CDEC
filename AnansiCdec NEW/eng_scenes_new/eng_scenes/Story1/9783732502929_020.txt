But she had hardly rested an hour when she suddenly startled again. From her mother's camp, a convulsive rattling sounded in her ear. She jumped up - she knew this rattle. The mother had another seizure. She switched on the light, lifted the mother's upper body and opened the nightgown at the neck. Frau von Salten looked up at her daughter with an agonized look, reared up high and fell back into the pillows with a deep sigh. Her body stretched strangely. Heavy fell the head back, and the eyes broke. Frau von Salten had suffered - she was dead. Rosemarie was overcome by a nameless fear. It was quiet in the house. She was all alone with her mother. Fearfully she looked into the rigid face, into the broken eyes. And then she understood what had happened. With a wail she collapsed to her knees and closed her dead eyes. "Mama, dear Mama, can't you hear me anymore?" she asked, sobbing. As strangers as mother and daughter had been to each other inwardly, Rosemarie felt in that hour that she had loved her mother and that, in spite of everything, it was a bitter loss that struck her. She was now all alone in the world. She no longer had anyone who belonged to her. She suddenly jumped up, overwhelmed by her fear. Could it be? Was her mother really dead, was there no more help for her? She tore at the doorbell and rang the bell. It came alive in the house. The owner of the boarding house was the first to appear. "Please, quickly a doctor! My mother - she is dying - quickly a doctor!" It was sent to the doctor. When he appeared after half an hour, he could only state the death of Mrs. von Salten.
