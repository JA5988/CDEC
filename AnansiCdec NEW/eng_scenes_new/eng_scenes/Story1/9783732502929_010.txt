Unsuspectingly, Rosemarie had slept through the night that decided her fate. Before she went to bed that evening, she had talked to her mother about her engagement. Her mother only said: "I have always been afraid, Rosemarie, that one day your heart would play an evil trick on you. You are rather sentimental and always behaved negatively when I made it clear to you that you were only allowed to make a good match. Now, thank goodness, you have lost your heart to a very rich young man. The Rittners are really enormously rich, and you will lead a brilliant, carefree life. So my sacrifices were not made in vain after all. Thank goodness, oh, thank goodness! You have no idea, Rosemarie, how happy your choice makes me! Now you will soon have the home you have longed for, and I - I too will finally be able to rest. All my hope was with you. It is time for me, my child, to be released from my torturous worries, for I often feel quite miserable lately. I, too, long for a peaceful retirement." "You will find that, dear mother. Fred is so good. And I have already told him that I am quite poor." Frau von Salten looked at her inquiringly. "You told him that?" "Yes, mama." "And how did he take it?" "A little astonished at first. But then he laughed and said he had enough for himself and me." Frau von Salten was glad of this. She said to herself, breathing a sigh of relief, that now she would not have to make any secret of her poverty to the Rittner brothers. And so the matter of the borrowed five thousand marks would also be easily settled. After all, it was now staying in the family! Rosemarie had gone to her small bedroom next to her mother's, after she had said goodbye to her more warmly than usual. She had also gone straight to rest, but saw through the crack in the door that her mother still had the light on for a long time. It was still burning when she fell asleep.
