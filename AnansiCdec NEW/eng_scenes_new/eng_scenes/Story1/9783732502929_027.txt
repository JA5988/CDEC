And so she was still sitting when, after hours, there was a knock at her door. She startled and looked around her like a hunted deer that fears the hunter. There was another knock. She rose with difficulty. "Who is it?" she asked in a hoarse voice, without opening the door. It was the chambermaid. The Countess Rosenberg had asked if the madam would not like to come to her. Rosemarie clenched her teeth. She could not make up her mind to open the door. "I've been lying down, I have a headache. Tell the Countess I'll have her call on me in the morning," she groaned harshly. The girl moved away outside. And Rosemarie sank down again, powerless, on the divan and stared ahead of her as if out of her mind. She lay like that all day without eating, and all night without sleeping.
