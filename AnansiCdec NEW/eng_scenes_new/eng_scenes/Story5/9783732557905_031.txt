She had just started doing the dishes when the phone rang. It was her mother-in-law. "Can I count on you on Saturday?" she asked. "Actually, we need you in the store every day, but unfortunately we can't persuade you to do that. That said, Lilly always has the most fun with us." "Ellen, it's not just about Lilly, it's also about my household. I really have enough to do, especially before Christmas. And I haven't got all the presents together yet either." "Of course, I understand that. But maybe you could at least come part-time? Preferably tomorrow, because ..." "Lilly's sick," Marissa interrupted her mother-in-law. "What do you mean, again?" "Yes, unfortunately. Since this morning. Tummy ache, earache and a cold." "Take her to Dr. Rieckert, he always prescribes good medicines," Ellen recommended. "They're not that good, because they only help to a certain extent," Marissa objected. "Better, I'll take her to that pediatrician, Dr. Bergen on Beethoven Street. You know, whose wife recently bought a play table and various toys from us for his waiting room." "Why change doctors? Dr. Bergen won't be a miracle worker either. Dr. Rieckert has been our family doctor for a long time, and I couldn't think of a better one." "Still, it's never wrong to get a second opinion," Marissa objected. "But for now, I want to wait and see if the medication helps." "Let me know," Ellen pleaded. "We really need you badly." Marissa promised. Then she went back to the kitchen.
