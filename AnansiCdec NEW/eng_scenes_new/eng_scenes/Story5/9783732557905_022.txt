On Saturday morning, Andrea and Franzi drove into town right after breakfast. "Then there's not so much going on yet," Andrea had meant. "Later, I'm sure it will be insanely crowded everywhere." But it already was when Andrea and Franzi arrived downtown and drove into the parking garage. Already there, cars were crowding the entrance. "This is going to be fun," Andrea said and sighed. A little later, they mingled with the stream of passersby. Andrea took the shopping list out of her purse that her mother-in-law Hilde had given her. She herself also had a long list of errands, but she didn't necessarily have to do them all today. "Let's go buy the toys right now!" urged Franzi. "There's the department store up ahead." "Let's get the most important things first," Andrea curbed her eagerness. "Then we can take our time afterwards. I'd also rather go to a toy store than a department store. They have a bigger selection there." "But it's also more expensive," Franzi objected. "At the department store, we get more stuff for the money Dad forked out." Andrea had to smile. "Paid out? Oh, he's been very generous. We don't really need that many new toys, because the play corner in his waiting room isn't very big. We'll see."
