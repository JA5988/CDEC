New examinations were performed, special therapies were considered. A bone marrow smear was taken and a chromosomal analysis was performed. Finally, the parents were told that only a stem cell transplant could save Lilly's life. "And if that doesn't help either - what then?" asked Carsten hoarsely. Dr. Gellert lowered his eyes, and Dr. Baumg√§rtner played with his pen. Marissa had to swallow several times. New fears for Lilly constricted her throat. "These stem cell transplants are usually quite successful," Dr. Gellert finally said. "All we need is a compatible donor. I would suggest that you, as parents, get tested first. Probably then we won't need to look any further." Marissa breathed a sigh of relief. There was hope yet. "Can we get tested right now today?" she asked. "Come back tomorrow morning," the attending asked. "I won't be able to get another appointment today for this typing procedure." "What is actually done in the process?" wanted Carsten to know. "Blood and saliva samples are taken, which are used to determine the most important tissue characteristics, the so-called HLA types," Dr. Gellert explained. "So it's not even so much a matter of matching blood types." Carsten was also relieved. "Then it shouldn't be difficult to find a suitable donor within our family."
