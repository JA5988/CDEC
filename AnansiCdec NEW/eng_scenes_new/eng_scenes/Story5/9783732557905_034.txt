"We really needed you, Marissa." Urgently, Carsten Phillips looked at his wife. "I promised Mom I'd talk you into coming to the store tomorrow." Marissa heaved a deep sigh. "Carsten, honey, Lilly's sick again after all. For the third time in a short time. I want to take her to see Dr. Bergen, not to the store where all sorts of people are spreading their germs." Carsten smiled mildly. "You're exaggerating, dear. It's not that bad. And Lilly doesn't have to come into contact with the customers, after all. She can play in the office just as well as at home." "That makes me laugh!" Marissa actually let out a small laugh. "You know yourself that Lilly is always wandering around the sales floor. On top of that, you have to be careful that she doesn't even escape from the store." "I'm not sick at all!" shouted Lilly from her play corner in the living room, where her parents had made themselves comfortable with a glass of mulled wine after dinner. "I want to go to the store with you. I'm sure the lovely lady with the nice big girl will be back tomorrow." Marissa rolled her eyes. How many times had Lilly asked about Dr. Bergen and her daughter! But they had not come since. I'll make an appointment with her husband, Marissa decided. Maybe they would meet there. Marissa caught a wait-and-see look from her husband. Carsten was waiting for her to agree to come to the store tomorrow. "All right," she conceded with a sigh, and Lilly cheered. "But now let's get to bed." For once, Lilly didn't protest. Hastily, she ran to the bathroom to brush her teeth. Marissa put her to bed as usual. While undressing, she noticed a strange pustule on Lilly's chest. However, Lilly did not allow her mother to take a closer look at the inflamed area. She wanted to sleep immediately so that she would be completely healthy tomorrow when they went to the store. I'll take a closer look at it in the morning, Marissa decided, and kissed Lilly good night.
