Following an impulse, he steered the car into a parking space and got out. He wanted to visit Anna's grave again while he was already in town. A few minutes later he was standing in front of it. In the flower store at the entrance to the cemetery, he had bought a bunch of freesias, which she had always liked so much. His heart was filled with melancholy. He had loved Anna. Why hadn't she wanted to live - for him and her love? Because the addiction had been stronger. Theo had not been able to help her. No one had been able to help her because she had not wanted to be helped. She had lived in her own world, a world to which he had basically never had access, as he had later realized. Her grave was simple, but well-kept. Theo bent down and placed his flowers among the shells and colorful stones that lay on her grave. "All my love, Anna," he said softly. And he knew he would never come here again. It was all too long ago. He also wanted to go to the cemetery café one last time and have a coffee. Then his visit to his hometown was over. In the evening after the game, he would go home again. To Bonn, where he had built a new life for himself after returning from India, without ever contacting his family again. Then, as he sat in the café drinking his coffee, his thoughts wandered back to his parents and brother. Carsten had remained neutral at the time, although he too had not approved of his friendship with Anna. Theo thought it was quite possible that Carsten - unlike his parents - had made some effort to find him. But Theo had not wanted to be found. He had been too hurt. Not only Anna's death had broken his heart, but also the break with his family. Did his parents feel sorry for their behavior back then? he asked himself again. And again the question arose whether he should not contact them. It could be that they were eagerly waiting for a sign of life from him. Theo decided to think about it. He paid for the coffee, left the café and went to his car.
