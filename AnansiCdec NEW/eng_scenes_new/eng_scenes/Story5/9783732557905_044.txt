Carsten immediately called his parents to relieve them of the uncertainty about Lilly's fate. They too wanted to come here immediately, but Carsten asked them to postpone their visit until tomorrow, when Lilly was awake. Dejected and with anxious hearts, they went to the pediatric intensive care unit. A friendly nurse let them in. In an anteroom, they had to change into a set of sterile paper gowns, then they were allowed to see Lilly. With her face bloated and her eyes closed, the little girl lay in bed, connected to all kinds of equipment with cables, tubes and wires. She was being fed oxygen through a nasal tube. It was a sight that almost broke Marissa's heart. "Lilly, my poor little darling, what are you doing!" Marissa's voice wavered with suppressed tears. When she tried to lean over the little girl, Carsten held her back. "We shouldn't get too close to her in case there really is something wrong with her immune system," he warned. Marissa nodded mutely. With burning eyes, she looked at her sick child. What had they done wrong? What had they missed? Marissa could answer it for herself. And she felt horribly guilty. In depressed silence, they drove home. Later, when they went into the bedroom and passed Lilly's door standing open, Marissa let out a dry sob. Lilly wasn't blissfully asleep in her crib as usual, or telling hair-raising stories about the creatures in the tree outside her window. Nor did she sit in her marital bed, surrounded by dolls and stuffed animals. Instead, she lay in the hospital and seemed closer to death than to life. Carsten took his wife comfortingly in his arms. "Cheer up, dear!" he said encouragingly, although his heart was also like a heavy stone in his chest. "I'm sure everything will look much better tomorrow."
