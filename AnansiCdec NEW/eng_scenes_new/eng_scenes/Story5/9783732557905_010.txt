Lorena dropped Paul off on the way and then drove home. She had rented a workshop with a small apartment above it from very nice elderly people, which was all she needed. Lorena turned into the lot and parked her van in the carport that adjoined the workshop. She left the foldable stage and the box with the puppets in the car, because the day after next she had a performance in a home for the disabled. Only the donkey she took with her to repair. Lorena's eyes fell on her bicycle, which was also in the carport. Ever since she was a child, she had been a passionate cyclist and rode in all weathers. Today, too, she wanted to cycle a bit in the meadows along the Rhine to get some fresh air. Because tomorrow she had to rehearse plays all day at the Rheintaler Puppenb√ºhne. Lorena took the donkey puppet in need of repair to the workshop and then went upstairs to her apartment. She opened the refrigerator. It was as good as empty. Her stomach growled as she did so. I will buy something on the way, she decided. So she ate an apple and a few cookies, and then swapped her jeans and sweater for her cycling outfit. Over that she pulled on another windbreaker and put a cap on her reddish-blond curly mane. Lorena enjoyed the ride through the Rhine meadows with all her heart. She pedaled vigorously. The cool weather and the wind blowing from the river did not bother her. Daily exercise in the fresh air was important to her. After a while, she pedaled back and made her way to the supermarket. She crossed the intersection at a brisk pace.
