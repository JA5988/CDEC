Then the day of the transplantation arrived. Andrea Bergen, who had been visiting Lilly regularly since her admission, checked on her once more. "You don't have to be afraid, Lilly," she said comfortingly. "It won't hurt at all, either. At most, the prick with the needle." "I'm not scared at all, either," Lilly explained with a weighty expression. "I'm a very brave girl." Andrea laughed. "I know that already, you brave little adventuress. Quite a brave one you are." The stem cell transplant didn't take long and was completely unspectacular. Under general anesthesia, a special needle was used to remove a certain amount of bone marrow-blood mixture from the donor's iliac crest, from which the stem cells were later filtered out and purified. After this procedure was completed, Lilly was given the stem cells intravenously, which also did not take long. After the transplantation, Lilly had to lie in the isolation tent again for a while. But brave as she was, she accepted her fate without grumbling and waved happily when her parents or grandparents appeared at the glass window.
