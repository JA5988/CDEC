Theo had to stay at Elisabeth Hospital for two more days until he could go home again. The family also looked after him several times. Theo enjoyed having them all around. And, of course, Lorena also sat by his bedside in her spare time, albeit sparse. "Do you want me to play something for you?" she asked the afternoon after his blood was drawn. "Did you bring your puppet show?" "Just two puppets, that's all I need. But you have to pay admission first." "Unfortunately, I don't have any money with me," Theo complained, while there was a sly flash in his eyes. "Can I pay the entrance fee with kisses?" "I wouldn't have taken anything else," Lorena let him know, bending over him and collecting her "entrance fee." The dolls she produced from her bag were a red-blond princess and a youth with curly hair. Lorena turned the chair around, sat astride it, and hung a colorful cloth over the back. This was her stage. Behind it, the action was taking place. And she played a sweet story of a young couple who had found each other because the man had run the woman over with his car.
