"Your gingerbread house turned out really great," Franzi praised. She looked appreciatively from the icing-decorated work of art made of gingerbread and Smarties to her grandmother and Henriette Fink, the long-time assistant who was already almost part of the family. Together, the two older ladies had made the gingerbread house for the Christmas party in the children's ward at Elisabeth Hospital. "Much too good to eat," Werner said. "No one will dare snack on it." "Then you bring it back home and we eat it up," Franzi suggested pragmatically. A bigger problem was transportation. The gingerbread house was the size of a doghouse, and Andrea didn't know how she was going to get it to Elisabeth Hospital. "We'll have to borrow another trailer," she said, sighing. "But a closed one," Hilde pleaded. "We don't want the gingerbread house to get wet."
