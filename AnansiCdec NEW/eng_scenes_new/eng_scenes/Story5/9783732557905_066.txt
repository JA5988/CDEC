The very next day, there was a solution to this problem as well. When Lorena Werding heard about it, she spontaneously offered to fetch the gingerbread house with her minivan. And so it was done. Together with Theo Phillips, she appeared on the eve of the Christmas party and loaded the gingerbread house into her van with him. They too admired it from all sides. "Thank you so much for doing the transport, Lorena," said Andrea, who had helped carry the gingerbread house out of the house as carefully as she could. "I'll see you tomorrow at the party. I'm looking forward to seeing your puppet show." Andrea waved after the two of them. She was heartily happy for the young couple. Lorena and Theo were so well suited to each other.
