Around lunchtime, the rush subsided somewhat, as usual. "Go to the table, children," Ellen said. "Lilly can eat with us later. I brought us something from home. Goulash and noodles, she likes that so much." "All right, Ellen," Marissa replied. "We'll be back in an hour. I'll check on Lilly for a minute." She let Carsten know they could go to lunch in a few minutes and hurried to her mother-in-law's office. There was also a sitting area there with a coffee maker and a microwave oven. In another corner, Lilly sat with a shoebox of odds and ends in front of her. She was holding something in her hand, looking at it curiously. "Mommy, who is this?" she asked, holding up a small photo in a frame. "Daddy?" Marissa moved closer. The photo showed a young man of about nineteen, twenty, who at first glance could have been mistaken for Carsten. When she turned the picture over, she read the name Theo. Carsten's younger brother, then, the black sheep of the family! "I don't know who that is," Marissa fibbed. "Where did you get this? What are these things anyway?" "Found it," Lilly explained. "Where?" "In Grandma's desk. Way in the back in the big drawer." Lilly rose and walked on her strapping little legs to the desk. "There," she said, pointing with her finger. "Then let's put that box back. Those are Grandma's private things, you can't just take them out. It's not something to play with." "Okay," Lilly said meekly. Marissa put the shoebox back and closed the compartment. Then she told her daughter that Daddy and she were leaving now for an hour. "Bye," was all Lilly said and skipped back to her toys. Smiling, Marissa left the office. She was looking forward to her lunch break with Carsten and a quiet hour in the stylish restaurant rooms of the Ratsstuben.
