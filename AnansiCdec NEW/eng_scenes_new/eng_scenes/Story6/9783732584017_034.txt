 The glider swayed as it lifted off the ground fully loaded. But the thrust was enough to carry them safely first across the city and then over the thorny barrier. The city was left behind them, and with it tens of thousands of innocent Romans. It pained Matt that he could not save them. It was small consolation that the one responsible for their fate died with them - if Patrem was not already dead. "Where are we going esss?" asked Ydiel behind them. "Rymaris is the best place," Quart'ol suggested. "That's the nearest Hydrite city, about three hundred kilometers north." Matt entered the destination point. He kept the glider close above ground and did not use the thrust to its fullest. The most important thing now was to stay in the air. He looked at his watch - fifty-four minutes to go. During the flight, Quart'ol was already contacting the Rymaris colonels to request temporary asylum for the passengers. Matt could tell by the look on his face that he wasn't entirely comfortable with that. After all, some of them had recently been meat eaters and impulsive to say the least. In an emergency situation like the one here on board, those instincts might be muted. But the question of whether they were really ready to live peacefully among their civilized peers and renounce meat-eating forever was entirely appropriate. The Hydrites would have to adjust to many a new technology as well as regulations or social norms. And for that, they were best off among their own kind. "They will clear and pump empty a sluice chamber for the underwater landing, which is otherwise for transport jellyfish," Quart'ol said after he ended the radio link. Another invaluable advantage of Takeo's glider: it could not only fly, but also dive.
