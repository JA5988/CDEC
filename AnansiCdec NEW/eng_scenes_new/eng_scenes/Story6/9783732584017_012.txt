A few minutes later, Shin'loa led them through the narrow network of tunnels under the city to one of the fountain exits on the south side of the harbor. She seemed invigorated, grown by the new tasks. Her father seemed to have noticed as well, for Quart'ol saw him looking at his daughter with fatherly pride. Shin'loa was the first to rise from the well, followed by Aruula, Ydiel, and Quart'ol. Then the crowd of fierce hydrites. Guan'ril brought up the rear. They were lucky; the sky was indeed dark and cloudy. The night and a light ground fog blurred the silhouettes of the hydrites into vague shadows. Wind blew from the sea, but the water followed its own laws. Whirlpools could be seen reaching into the depths as smaller and larger funnels. The fishermen had moored their barges safely in the harbor. No one in his right mind dared to go out to sea in these conditions, either at night or during the day. This was the only good thing in all the terrible news: They were relatively safe from detection. Then the group scurried along the harbor to the waterline and followed the coast south. Shin'loa led them along the border between land and sea as long as it was possible, for Aruula and Ydiel, at least, had neither gills nor fins to keep up on the waterway. When the flat beach turned into rockier territory, she stopped. "From here we'll have to swim and dive the last bit through a crevice in the rocky outcrop," she said, looking first at him and then at his two friends. "We will take you in the middle," Guan'ril said. "All you have to do is hold your breath." Aruula and Ydiel did not seem pleased, but agreed. Quart'ol, as he dove in, felt he could finally wash himself clean of the filth of this place. Underwater, his gaze reached almost into infinity. But he knew that the impression was deceptive. They were all stuck. Still imprisoned and around them a grotesquely disfigured stage of their former reality.
