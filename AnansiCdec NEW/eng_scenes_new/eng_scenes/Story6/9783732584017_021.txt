She opened the side door to the stairway into the tower, when from the other side a person in healer's garb ran into the room, looked around and shouted, "He is completely out of his mind! Leave the palace! Only the gods can save us now!" Aruula followed her inner impulse, ran towards the man, stood in his way and grabbed him by the shoulder. "Who, who are you talking about?" she asked in a threatening voice, while holding the drawn sword to his throat with her other hand. The man shrieked and squirmed helplessly. "From Cesar Aticus. I know this is tantamount to blasphemy. But as a medicus, I can assure you that he is no longer himself!" Aruula's brows drew together. That could mean many things. Perhaps Patrem had taken possession of his body anew. But did the medico even know how his ruler acted without the archivist's influence? How often and how long had he taken the place of the Cesar? And what effect had this technology had on the true Aticus? Either way, he was their best lead. "Where do I find him?" asked Aruula, pressing the blade harder against his neck. "In the infirmary," the healer pressed out. "He was talking like a man possessed! But I think he was going into the courtyard to find his Mystery Master." Aruula let go of the medic. The man slid to the ground and crouched down, whimpering, his arms protectively draped over his head. "Where is this infirmary?" she asked, looking down at the pile of misery with pity. "Down the main corridor toward the exit," the medic returned tearfully. "The door with the Askepios snake on it. That's where he was last, recovering from a collapse. He had been found in the tower." "Go and take your family with you. Flee the city. Leave everything behind. Otherwise you will be lost," Aruula said before she left. But instinctively she knew there was no escape. Not for any of them.
