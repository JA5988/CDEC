 Since Prince de Sablemer was allowed to set up his office in the castle as his fianc√©, Count Paul moved with him. While the female members were preparing for the double wedding, the men were busy planning to set up a branch of "Francoise-Kosmetik" in Munich. This involved impeccably cooled warehouses - the organic cosmetics were naturally susceptible - as well as the connection to the right large-scale distribution. Should "Francoise cosmetics" be sold in drugstores, perfumeries, beauty salons or even pharmacies? Of the two princesses, only Alessandra could be seen in the offices in the west wing, which had the large fountain as a view from the other side. Seen from here, the "Europa" rose from the floods - a bull with massive shoulders, on whose back sat a delicate young girl. While Paul would have been pleased to see Leonie in the study, Alessandra's presence made him uncomfortable. The beautiful princess darted through the rooms, asking a lot of questions, touching everything, and complaining that she was no longer allowed to translate the letters for the prince because Paul was now back. Julien at first reacted with slight irritation to Alessandra's perfumed appearances. Then he was amused. Especially when Alessandra thought up teasing little things to remind him that life wasn't all work. Paul shuddered when he once inadvertently witnessed a striptease through the crack of a door. Leonie, on the other hand, became increasingly quiet and introverted in the weeks leading up to the wedding. She and Paul ducked each other, of course, but it had not come to a second kiss.
