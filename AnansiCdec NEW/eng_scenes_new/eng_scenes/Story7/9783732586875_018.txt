 From then on, Leonie was a contented person. This totally underpaid work gave her pleasure. Her days were filled with research in archives and interviews with people who were happy to tell an educated and well-bred young woman about their past or their plans for the future. Even delivering her reports to the "editorial office," a once huge old printing plant where the Krohn siblings now operated, was fun. Vera's brother Piet was as unconventional a bon vivant as his sister. His main job was not printing, but hunting for advertisers to keep the Sonntagsbl√§ttchen afloat financially. Incidentally, Piet Krohn was also the newspaper's only photographer, so that Leonie and he often - and increasingly often - appeared as a successful team when they interviewed old admirals, once-famous actors, musicians, singing stars and down-and-out existences in their mansions and houses on the Elbchaussee. Everything suddenly made more sense to Leonie. For example, the fact that Paul had immediately put a small car in her garage in Hamburg. The computer in her study was also suddenly useful to her. But what seemed most important to her was that she could report on her day in the evening over Martha's delicious meal. She could see it in Paul's eyes how pleased he was that she had woken up from her slumber. So Leonie was fully occupied and almost forgot to follow the social life of her beautiful sister and her French prince consort. Sometimes, as she passed drugstores and perfumeries, she saw the poster of "Francoise Cosmetics." In front, blooming lavender fields waved, and in the background, Sablemer Castle loomed in the blue Provence sky. Out of the blooming fields floated - like a kind of genie - the silhouette of a naked woman. It amused Leonie to think that Alessandra could be the lady in the lavender field. Vain as Alessandra was, she must have been keen to have her beautiful figure at least immortalized on a poster. But what was that to do with Leonie now?
