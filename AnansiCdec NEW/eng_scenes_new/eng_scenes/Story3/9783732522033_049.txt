Countess Beate had had every little corner cleaned; but Griseldis had made a strange observation. The Countess herself went over to the tower, but she only entered it when all the windows were open and the people were already at work. Then she even lent a hand here and there and moved the furniture back and forth with her own hands. The servants could do nothing right for her, and at every opportunity she flinched and looked around shyly and uneasily. And when the work was done, when every room was clean, the Countess was the first to leave the tower. She stood for a while below beside the open door, leaning against the wall like one seriously ill. And over her body ran shiver after shiver, and cold sweat beaded on her forehead, which she dried, holding the cloth with trembling hands. At table, the comtesse had then delivered the key of the tower to Count Harro. "It's all right now, Harro," she said, and Griseldis felt as if she were no longer so reluctant to see Griseldis handed the tower key.
