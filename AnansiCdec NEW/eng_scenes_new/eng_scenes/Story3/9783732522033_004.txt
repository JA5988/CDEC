 Suddenly something white came down the stairs. It was little Comtesse Gilda, a lovely five-year-old child with blond curls and deep blue eyes. "Papa! My dear, good Papa!" He caught her in his arms and hugged her tightly. From his chest came like a moan. "My little Gilda - my dear child," he said with touching tenderness, and climbed the stairs with her. He carried her back to her bedroom to her bed. Carefully he tucked her in. And there the little comtesse saw that her father had tears in his eyes. With a jerk she sat up. Pale and affected, she looked at him. "Why are you crying, papa? Are you angry that I ran to meet you?" "No, oh no. I am crying for joy that you did it because you had a longing for me." "Great, great longing I had for you. When you went away with the foreign lords, I cried for so long. And there was no one to comfort me." For the first time he considered that the misfortune that had affected him would also cast shadows on the fate of his daughter. It would attach to her that she was the daughter of a man who had been restored his freedom only for lack of evidence. Just as he was regarded in the world as a murderer of husbands, his daughter would be seen as the child of a murderer - if he did not succeed in throwing light on the mysterious matter, but how was he to fathom what all the acumen of his judges had been unable to fathom? "Now sleep, my darling." "Good night, papa. And may all the little angels keep you," said Gilda, her pious little saying. "You too, my darling." Gilda snuggled into her crib, and a few minutes later she was fast asleep. With a sigh, the Count departed after calling the attendant to her post.
