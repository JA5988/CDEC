Griseldis put Gilda to rest for her afternoon nap. But she was so serious and quiet about it that for the first time Gilda was not pleased with her young governess. And when, after a while, her father came to give her a kiss before going to bed, as usual, she said, "Griseldis has a headache, Papa. She didn't have any fun at all with me today." "Are you not well, Fr√§ulein von Ronach?" "It is nothing of importance, Count. As long as Gilda is asleep, I will take a walk in the woods. Then my headache will soon go away." Griseldis did not have a headache, but she had been seized with restlessness and anxiousness, which were usually foreign to her, as if some calamity were before her. Something had awakened in her soul, as a result of her dream and the strange behavior of the Countess, which she was afraid to think about. And yet the thought did not let her go.
