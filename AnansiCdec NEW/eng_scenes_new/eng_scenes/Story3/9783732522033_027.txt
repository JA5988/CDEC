 At the same moment, Beate came out of the utility rooms. Suddenly, quite unexpectedly, she was standing in front of the picture of Countess Alice. She flinched and let out a scream in horror. It had seemed to her as if the Countess was actually standing in front of her. Count Harro and Griseldis quickly returned to the hall. There they saw Beate standing leaning against the banister with her face covered. "What has happened, Beate?" asked the Count, hurrying toward her. The comtesse lowered her hands from the pale, paled face. "It's nothing, Harro, I - I just hadn't noticed the picture, and I almost knocked it over," she said, hoarsely and harshly with suppressed excitement. "You've become very nervous and jumpy, Beate. That wasn't the case before. There you could never understand how anyone could be nervous. But of course, this exciting time we've been through, it shakes even strong nerves. I shouldn't have left the picture here," Harro said in a soothing tone. He immediately gave the order and had the picture carried upstairs. Griseldis had observed the whole scene. She looked inquiringly at the comtesse. How strange that she stared so shyly and fearfully at the picture of Countess Alice. She must have been very frightened. Now that the picture was taken away, she breathed a sigh of relief.
