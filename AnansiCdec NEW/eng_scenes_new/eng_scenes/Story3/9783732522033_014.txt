 After a three-hour journey, the two ladies arrived at the train station closest to the monastery. Next to the station building, the venerable monastery carriage, somewhat gray with age, stopped. It was harnessed with two lean nags, and on the goat, in a threadbare coat with a formerly black but now somewhat foxy fur collar, sat Christian, the factotum of the monastery. "Good day, Christian," said Aunt Agnes kindly. All the ladies of the convent were on good terms with Christian, because he was needed for all sorts of things for which female strength was not sufficient. And Christian knew that. Therefore he held on to dignity and forgave himself nothing. "This is my niece, Christian." Christian looked down at Griseldis from the side, and her young, laughing face conjured a friendly smile around his mouth as well. "We haven't had anything so young in the pen for a long time. But now you get in. My nags have certainly become as stiff as I myself," he said, half condescendingly, half reproachfully. In the meantime, the porter had loaded the suitcases, and the ladies got in.
