After his talk with Beate, Harro had saddled his horse and ridden out into the fields. He returned home at teatime. His little daughter met him in the hall, saddened. "Oh, Papa, at least you're here at last. I am so alone." He took her in his arms and kissed her. "Alone, Gilda? Is not Miss von Ronach with you?" "No, papa, she is gone." Count Harro looked around at Henriette. "What do you mean Henriette? Where is Fr채ulein von Ronach, then?" "She's probably gone over to Dalheim. Berta told me so." "Send me Berta, Henriette, I want to ask her myself." He went with Gilda to the tea-room, and presently Berta entered. "What did Fr채ulein von Ronach tell you to do when she left?" "I did not see Fr채ulein von Ronach myself, Count. Comtesse Beate told me that." "Comtesse Beate?" "Yes. I am to report to the Count that Fr채ulein von Ronach has taken leave of absence until the evening to go over to Dalheim." Berta also reported that Comtesse Beate had laid down because she had felt very ill, and that she did not want to be disturbed until the next morning. But that worried him much less than the fact that Griseldis was not there. "It's all right, you can go." Gilda whined for Griseldis, and he would have liked to join in. He did not like at all that Griseldis was not there. He felt how empty and meaningless his life was without her. He racked his brains as to why she had left without notifying him. I'd better ride over to Dalheim after all, he thought, and had his horse shown to him again. Full of anxiety, he peered around as he rode through the forest to Dalheim. But Griseldis did not meet him. Baron Dalheim had not seen Griseldis either. Count Harro rode back to Treuenfels in a great hurry.
