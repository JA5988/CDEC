 Griseldis did not see Count Harro again until the evening meal. At the table, Griseldis handed the Count the keys to Countess Alice's rooms. "I thank you, Count, for allowing me to see these rooms," she said. And she noticed very well that she was being watched by Comtesse Beate with an uneasy lurking look. "I suppose you can give me back the key to the tower in a moment, Harro," the comtesse turned to her cousin, "so that I may keep it again." "Tomorrow morning the steps will be bricked up, and when that is done I want to give the key to Fr√§ulein von Ronach. She would like to enjoy the view from the tower gallery more often." The comtesse was half senseless with jealousy. But she had to submit to the Count's stipulations. Immediately after dinner she was called away on a domestic matter, and Harro and Griseldis were alone for a while. "You will surely laugh at me, Count, but in my dream I caught sight, set into the wall of the Countess's bedroom, of a secret closet. Are you perhaps aware of such a thing?" "You seem to have dreamed a whole novel. I'm sorry to disappoint you. There are no secret closets in Treuenfels. You have seen, haven't you, that the wood paneling covers all the walls?" Griseldis now knew what she wanted to know, namely that the count really had no idea about secret closets. "That's what I told myself. But there could be closets in other rooms." "You seem to have taken it into your head to romanticize Treuenfels. To calm yourself down, I advise you to read through our family chronicle. In it every room of the castle is described in detail, and everything that our family has experienced and suffered you will find recorded in it. It is a very extensive book. But my cousin Beate, I think, has learned the whole chronicle by heart. She spent half the night reading it."
