The storm howled and roared over forests and fields, bending the strongest trees so that they shook their crowns, which did not yet bear green leaves, and bending young saplings in the forests. Such a storm, which made the rain rain down at an angle, did not make a stay in the open air pleasant. This opinion was also shared by the driver of the motor vehicle, who steered a vehicle through the storm-tossed forest. The truck drove slowly and carefully, for darkness had already fallen, and here and there a tree trunk bent by the storm lay across the path. Next to the driver sat a servant. The latter had to get out repeatedly to clear the obstacles out of the way. "It's like all the devils are out today," he said angrily. "Pure hell weather." They looked timidly at the motor vehicle, which meanwhile was parked by the road. For a moment a pale man's face had appeared at the window of the vehicle, from which the eyes looked gloomy. The occupant of the car had apparently leaned back into the cushions again apathetically, when the way was clear again. And soon the car drove out of the forest and up a gradually rising hill.
