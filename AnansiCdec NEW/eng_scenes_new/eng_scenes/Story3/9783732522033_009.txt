 When he woke up in the morning, the sun was shining. He opened the window. The air was cool, perhaps not far from freezing, as is still often the case in March, but of delicious freshness and purity. Deeply he inhaled, and then, with Grollmann's help, quickly dressed. He had just finished when a couple of children's fists knocked on his door. "Papa -love Papa!" sounded a soft, tender little voice. He opened quickly. Outside stood his little girl, dressed in white, laughing up at him. He took her in his arms and hugged her as much as he could without hurting her. Father and daughter walked hand in hand down to the breakfast room. There the table was invitingly set, even flowers had been placed by Comtesse Beate. She was already expecting father and daughter. Harro forgot what was pressing him under his daughter's chatter. "Is it true, Papa, that Mademoiselle has left? Henriette told me," Gilda asked after a while. "Yes, Gilda, she has gone. Are you sorry?" "No, not at all - I may go for a walk with you, after all, you promised me." "I'll keep that promise, too," the father replied.
