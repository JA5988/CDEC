But a short time later he met Kathleen Flaherty. At a horse show, when he got the first victory on the stallion Lord Archibald. Kathleen came from Cork. She was the daughter of a doctor and was studying medicine herself. She was the same age as Patrick. He could talk to her about any problems, as he had done with his mother in the past. Since the Duchess was no longer alive, he had felt very lonely. But Kathleen was also a very beautiful girl. She had dark hair and greenish eyes, dressed very tastefully, and was an avid athlete. And she loved Patrick. She confessed that to him with the frankness that he liked so much about her. Nor did he have to fear that she would want to marry him because of his title or because of his wealth, for she herself came from a very distinguished and wealthy family. There was only one thing Patrick did not like: that Kathleen was studying in Dublin. Now she had a semester break. But when she left again, he would feel very abandoned.
