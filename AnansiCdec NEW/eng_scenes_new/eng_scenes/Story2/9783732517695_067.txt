*** Duke Brian spent the least time in the castle. He often slept in his room in the steward's house of the estate. People had become accustomed to him showing up early in the morning and having breakfast with them in the servants' quarters. It was no longer a secret that Duke Brian avoided being with his wife and with Robert. The only one he got along with was the young Duchess Gwendolin. She often came to the estate. Caring, the old duke then led her along the country lanes and went with her to the river. Sometimes they talked about Patrick. Gwendolin did not know him, but his fate interested her. Time and again she suspected that her husband and mother-in-law had driven him away. Gwendolin had not been happy with Robert. He treated her as unlovingly as he was. Even marriage had not been able to change him. Tenderness was foreign to him, he made no effort to win her love, now he was just waiting for a son. A boy who would immediately bear the title of Duke Young of Windhome should consolidate his position. Gwendolin had no rights in the castle. She was unable to assert herself against her mother-in-law. All those who had hoped that Duchess Alice's power would be broken by Gwendolin had been disappointed. Duke Brian and Gwendolin, however, were united by a deep feeling of affection. That the young woman called him father made him happy. She was the only ray of hope in his dreary life. She often reminded him of his wife Mary in her cuddly and dreamy manner.
