In the castle, the servants once again put their heads together. They had noticed that Duchess Alice's influence on her husband was beginning to wane. She herself noticed it best of all. And she knew that she had to act immediately if she did not want to be pushed off her throne. Her husband and Duke Patrick had become closer again. Robert was mainly to blame for this. Duchess Alice could not understand him. And she was angry that he had simply left. For hours she sat on the phone and called all those places he used to visit. It wasn't until the next day that she reached him at a hotel in Killarney. Robert admitted that he had wanted to coerce Kathleen into giving herself to him. He acted offended that his mother blamed him. Again and again he tried to teach her that he had wanted to separate Kathleen and Patrick. In biting words, his mother mocked him. She reproached him that he was not capable of realizing their common plans without her help. After the telephone conversation, she went to see her husband.
