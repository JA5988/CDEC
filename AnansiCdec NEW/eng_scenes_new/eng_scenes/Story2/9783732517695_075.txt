Patrick was sitting slumped in his father's study when a constable ushered Kathleen in. She was barely recognizable, so distraught did she look. She could not exonerate Patrick. Everything seemed to be conspiring against him. For minutes they were alone in the room as the interrogation concluded. But outside the door stood a constable. "You couldn't have done that, Patrick," Kathleen said. "Or was everything you told me not true? Was your father not even willing to change his will? Then why did he call me to you?" Patrick looked at Kathleen as if she were a stranger. "Yes, why would he have done that? So you doubt me?" "I don't want to doubt you, Patrick. Our vow of love still holds true now, but I don't want you to have to go to the remand prison. No one can help you, including me. You will be condemned as a patricide, never again will the gates of the penitentiary open for you." Patrick pressed his hands to his ears. "Please, be silent, Kathleen. I can't listen to this. I have lost my father. Not by the spite of fate, he was murdered." Patrick dropped his hands in resignation. "You're right, no one can help me." Kathleen stepped close to him. "You have to escape, Patrick. Go back to Australia and ..." She got no further; a constable entered the room and asked, "Go, Miss Flaherty. You are no longer needed." At that second, Patrick yelled, "I need you, Kathleen! Don't leave!" The constable pushed Kathleen out of the room. She did not resist. Tears streaming down her face, she glanced back at Patrick one more time, then he couldn't see her anymore. He heard the constables talking to her outside in the hallway, then their voices and footsteps faded away. Patrick stepped to the window, he wanted to see Kathleen again when she left the castle.
