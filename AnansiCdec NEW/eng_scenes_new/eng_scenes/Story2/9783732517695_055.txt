*** For three days Patrick stayed on the estate without going into the castle. Often he stood at the gate and looked along the road. He waited for his father. But he did not come. The servants were already wondering why the Duke had so abruptly left his son in charge of the estate. And Patrick became more and more bitter. Kathleen had only been to the estate once for a few hours during this time. There had not been enough time to ride out. She was already in a travel fever. She loved her studies and had left no doubt that she wanted to finish them. Patrick hadn't minded that at first. He loved Kathleen's independent nature. They had not talked about the fact that she would not pursue her profession later. It was a given that she would assume her duties as mistress of Windhome when she was his wife.
