Patrick left the caretaker's house and went to the stables. The stallion Lord Archibald, an excellent show horse, had recently been stabled there. His father had given it to him. Patrick leaned his head against the horse's neck. "He's right, I belong at Windhome." The old groom Taylor came into the stable. When he saw the young duke standing in Lord Archibald's stall, he laughed. "That's a great horse, Duke Patrick. You'll only get victories with him. It's a shame you won't be back this year." "Take good care of Lord Archibald for me, Taylor, and ride him out every day. As soon as I get to Windhome, I'll train with him." Now Patrick's eyes began to shine again. He got the horse he had come with and rode back to the castle. Over the next few days he still avoided Alice Murray, but he did not set out to snub her. He began to resign himself to the fact that she would become his father's wife. And one thing she would certainly not ask of him was that he call her mother.
