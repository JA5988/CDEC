Patrick came back from the castle chapel. He had spent a long time at the tomb where his parents lay. Deep shock was on his face. Everything he wanted to tell Stella later had played out in his mind's eye. His life in Windhome Castle and his escape into the world. Suddenly Patrick raised his head. He had been disturbed by the buzzing of voices. Now he noticed twitching light. The pavilion was on fire. Gwendolin! Only this thought dominated, now Patrick. He ran to the pavilion. Behind him came people with hoses. In front of the burning pavilion stood Duke Robert. "My mother must be in the pavilion!" he shouted to the people. "She is not to be found in the castle." "And the young duchess?" asked Patrick of one of the men. He bowed his head. "No one can get out of this fire." Patrick ran past Duke Robert, ignoring him. "Kick down the door!" he shouted to the men. "By the time you put out the fire, it will be too late for Gwendolin." Now the first jet of water hissed against the pavilion. Under its protection, several men smashed the door. Cries of horror rang out, the men bent down. They pulled Duchess Alice into the open. Duke Robert sank beside her on the lawn and crossed himself. With a mad look he looked around. "Take my mother to the castle!" he ordered the men. "Doctor Ramsey must come at this hour." "He can't help her now, either," one of the men said. Patrick took one more look at the gazebo, then walked through the park to the gate. The wind had picked up again. Patrick turned around. "Whenever the wind blows this hard around the castle, disaster happens," he said. "It adds fuel to the fire." He walked past the tower. There was no sign of the castellan; surely he had left his place to walk to the fireplace. Patrick could not comprehend that this day had ended so terribly. What would Stella say to the fact that Gwendolin had met such a horrible death? He could also remember Robert's young beautiful wife now, although he had only seen her briefly earlier.
