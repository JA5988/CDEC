That she had fallen in love on the spot back in the fall was understandable. She was twenty-one, and for her Julien de Sablemer was the first truly stunning man of her life. But what the prince might find in her ... Julien de Sablemer, at any rate, seemed to have more and more business in the south of the country and to use the Wallmenroth exit more and more frequently - strangely enough, on the very days when Leonie used to visit the baroness. My God, that joy when she realized that she loved. The hope in her heart that he, too, felt something for her ... The first clandestine rendezvous in places where neither she nor the prince was known. The first shy kiss that set her heart on fire, and the second that gave her an inkling of the joys that awaited her in the arms of this experienced lover.
