During the tour of the factory, Rosemarie felt as if she were walking on rosy clouds. The workers looked after her with smiles. Something radiant emanated from her, which warmed their hearts. Finally, on their tour, they came to the laboratory. Here they found Fred at work. There was a twitch in Fred's eyes. And then he looked Rosemarie big and full in the eyes for the first time. "Will you give me your hand, Rosemarie? I want to wish you happiness - with all my heart. And at the same time I dare to ask you to forget the past. Wasn't it, you're not angry with me anymore?" Rosemarie looked gladly into his eyes. "I am much too happy to be angry with anyone." He drew her hand to his lips. "My brother's happiness is in your hands, Rosemarie. And if anything in me is great and good, it is my love for Magnus. For his happiness I shall always be your debtor." Magnus put his arm around Rosemarie. "Now I will lead my bride to Ellen. What do you think, Fred, will she release Rosemarie to me?" Fred laughed. "Try your luck!" He now led Rosemarie through the laboratory as well, explaining everything she wanted to know. Then the bride and groom took their leave. "Tell Ellen to have champagne chilled. Today at noon we must toast your health," Fred said with a smile.
