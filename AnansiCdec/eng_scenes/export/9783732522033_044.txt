The two gentlemen went out into the park and looked for Griseldis. The latter saw them coming and her heart pounded. She looked into Harro's face and saw a glow in his eyes. She might have gratefully pressed the Baron's hand that he had kept his promise. When the gentlemen had approached, Griseldis rose. "Fräulein von Ronach - permit me -, Baron Dalheim wishes to be introduced to you." "I come to you with a mission, gracious Fräulein," said the latter, and neither he nor Griseldis betrayed with a mien that they knew each other. "My bride, Miss Tilly von Sarnow, is at present staying with her mother in Dalheim, and today at noon her father arrives with her sister Ruth. My bride has heard of your being here and, at the same time on behalf of her mother, has asked for your visit. The whole Sarnow family will be delighted to welcome you." "I thank you, Baron. Please tell the ladies that I will be glad to come. I suppose I may take an afternoon off, Count?" "Of course! And I am glad that you will have a little diversion."
