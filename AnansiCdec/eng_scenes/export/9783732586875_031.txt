Leonie roared out of the hotel driveway. To fight a feeling of great sadness, she bit her lips. Her need for harmony was destroyed. A sports car she knew from before passed her on the other side of the street. The sight of the silver-gray car sent a seething thrill through her. It reminded her of so much, including the hours she had spent waiting by the window to watch that car whiz by on the street. And then the sight of it coming up the avenue and her ... Now Julien was driving past her. Her heart was racing. She felt this buzzing in her ears and tried to pull over to the right. The car began to skid and hit something. Maybe a lamppost or a parking meter. The impact itself was relatively harmless because the airbag didn't go off. Nevertheless, she must have been injured. All of this was reconstructed later when she was taken to the hospital because she was in too much pain relative to the impact accident. She lost the baby that very night. Paul's remonstrances about what she would have done out there alone that night were justified. Leonie didn't dare tell him what had really happened. She swindled that she had been called to an appointment together with Vera and prayed that Alessandra would not call and that the swindle would be exposed.
