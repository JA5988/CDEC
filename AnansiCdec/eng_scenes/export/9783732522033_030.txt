 Weeks had passed since Griseldis had stayed at Treuenfels Castle. And during these weeks she had grown so firmly into her new surroundings that she hardly thought about what had gone before. The feast of Pentecost was near. Griseldis enjoyed this first spring spent in the country. The child clung with tender love to her beautiful young governess, and Griseldis had decidedly a happy hand in regard to the care of this young human blossom. Beate lost more and more of her ground to Griseldis, she felt with impotent fury how she was pushed into the background by the latter. The deep grief about this and the hatred for Griseldis tore her heart apart. At times she could hardly conceal her feelings, and Count Harro often looked at his cousin with a shake of his head, because her actions seemed strange and odd to him.
