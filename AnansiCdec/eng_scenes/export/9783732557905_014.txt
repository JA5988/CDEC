A little later, he joined the traffic again. At an intersection, a young woman in a sports outfit on a bicycle caught his eye, mainly because of her reddish-blond curls that spilled out from under a black baseball cap. Theo steered the car a little to the left to give her more room. In the side mirror, he saw a truck still speeding through the intersection. Had this guy gone crazy? Before Theo could react in any way, he was already rammed by the truck. Theo slammed on the brakes and jerked the wheel around, but it was too late. A clang told him that he had knocked over the cyclist. Fortunately, the truck had now also come to a stop. Theo tumbled out of the car and over to the cyclist, who was lying face down on the curb. He felt sick with fright as he knelt down to her and gently touched her on the shoulder. "Can you hear me? Did you hurt yourself?" What a stupid question! Theo was completely confused. She did not answer. Theo pleaded to heaven that she was only unconscious, not dead. Fortunately, he couldn't see any bleeding. But she could have broken anything. So he preferred not to move her, even though he couldn't bear to watch her lying face down on the curb. Passersby came running from all sides. Drivers left their cars in the middle of the intersection to see what had happened. Who of all the people was the truck driver, Theo could not make out so quickly. But it didn't matter at the moment. He took out his cell phone and called the emergency services.
