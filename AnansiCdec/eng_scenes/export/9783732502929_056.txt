They had gotten as far as the exit during this conversation and had to break off. In front of them was an elegant car. Fred just lifted his wife into it and then looked around for his brother and his companion. Magnus hurried to help Rosemarie get in. Then the gentlemen also took their seats. The valet and the chambermaid followed with the luggage in another carriage. During the ride, Frau Ellen chatted harmlessly and cheerfully, and the gentlemen took pains to answer her in the same tone. The fact that Rosemarie was rather quiet was not noticed - at least not by Frau Ellen.
