Shin'loa was also about to say something when the sky suddenly lit up brightly. Aruula saw a pulsating hemisphere inflate over the entire city. The structure grew at breakneck speed. Everything in its path was swept upward and seemed to vanish in a blue glow. The last of all the waves was on its way to them. "It's happening," Aruula whispered. "We have to run!" shouted Shin'loa. But no one stirred. Quart'ol put a hand on her shoulder. "It will catch up with us." "And take us with it," Aruula added. Her mouth was dry. While Shin'loa's father came and took his daughter in his arms, the other Hydrites also moved together. At least they would die free. Among their own kind. Aruula closed her eyes and recalled an image from better days. She and Maddrax, how they had met. The many battles they had fought together. The quarrels they had had, but which had ended in reconciliation and love. They had conceived a child together, Daa'tan, who had been stolen from her womb by the Daa'muren and raised - and faced Maddrax in battle. His death was still an aching wound in Aruula's memory. What might have become of Daa'tan without the abduction! If Wudan willed it, they would meet again at the great table of warriors. When the warrior from the Thirteen Islands opened her eyes, she saw the wall of energy coming toward her. Trees, houses, animals, people, everything dissolved in the unreal blue light of this supernova. Maddrax! was the last thing she thought.
