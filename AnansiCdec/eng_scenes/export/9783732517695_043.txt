When Kathleen visited him at the estate one day, he left his work and went with her to the horse stables. "What are you up to, Patrick?" asked Kathleen. Patrick laughed. "You're in riding clothes, aren't you? Do you think I'll work while you ride out? I'll go with you. But where we ride, I decide. And I'm not telling yet." He kissed Kathleen exuberantly. A little later they left the farm. Duke Brian watched them go with satisfaction. Kathleen pleased him. Making love to her had made Patrick a little more approachable in the castle, too. He seemed to avoid friction with Robert. And that was a good thing. Duke Brian walked across the courtyard with weary steps. He thought of how unbearable it had been for him to hear about quarrels between Patrick and Robert over and over again. Of course, Alice always defended her son. It would also be fine with her if Patrick made a firm commitment soon.
