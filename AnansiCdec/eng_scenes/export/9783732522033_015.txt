It took about a good hour to reach the monastery. And when the carriage stopped and the ladies got out, the curious and expectant faces of the abbey ladies appeared at many windows. Griseldis looked around the old convent with wide eyes in delight. After passing through a narrow hallway, they arrived at a rather large hallway. Here Mother Anna received them with her kindly gracious dignity and greeted them warmly. Griseldis lost her heart to this beautiful old lady at the first moment. She bent over the offered hand and kissed it. Pleased, Mother Anna looked into the beautiful girl's face. "That will do us old women good, such a young blood in our midst," she said with a smile. An hour later Griseldis was introduced to all the convent ladies. She paid her heartfelt and sincere thanks to all for the gracious invitation. And Griseldis' sunny nature, her beautiful appearance and her lovely modesty won out all along the line.
