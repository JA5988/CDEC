There stood the old castellan Graham. He looked at her, startled. "I thought I heard someone scream, Miss Kathleen. Was it you?" Kathleen leaned against the old man, breathing heavily, in agony she looked back at the river. Now Duke Robert came up to the path. "Let's go to the castle, Graham," she said in a trembling voice. "He is a beast." The castellan took Kathleen to his apartment in the tower. He asked no questions, and Kathleen said no more. She sat in the chair with her hands clasped in front of her face. Nor did she think she could feel Robert's greedy hands. Again, disgust choked her. She rose to her feet. "Thank you, Graham," she said softly. The castellan accompanied her anxiously to the door. "There will be a terrible disaster at Windhome if Duke Patrick learns what has happened to you." Kathleen looked at the old man with wide eyes. So she hadn't even needed to tell him what had happened? "He'll get what he wants. Outside for money, around here under pressure that no one will dare accuse a Duke Young of Windhome anytime soon." The castellan smiled contemptuously. "A Duke Young of Windhome! Robert Murray, a day thief, an impostor, a girl-abuser. Poor Duke Brian." Kathleen hesitated a few more seconds, then put her hand on Graham's arm. "Please, keep quiet about what you witnessed. I'll think about telling Patrick. You're right, there would be a terrible misfortune." Kathleen left the tower at the Windhome gate. She went into the castle and got ready in the bathroom. Then she waited for Patrick.
