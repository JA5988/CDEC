The three Compsognathus' lay huddled close together and shivering in a corner of the large basement room, which was hermetically sealed off from the outside world by a massive pane of glass. Thanks to artificial light and an adjustable temperature and humidity, conditions here were ideal for them, at least in this respect. The Compsognathus belonged to the smallest dinosaurs at all. Its body was hardly bigger than that of a chicken. Only because of its long, pointed tail it reached a total body length of just under three quarters of a meter. Only occasionally one of the animals stirred. Actually they were nimble hunters, feeding on lizards and insects, and for that reason alone they had to be extremely fast and agile. However, since they had already hatched from their eggs in this room, they had had to get used to the confinement from childhood, and because they were also fed regularly, they were not dependent on hunting and killing prey, so they had of necessity become largely passive and sluggish. Boris Corman observed it with satisfaction. He had bred the dinosaurs, but he hated them with all his heart, and it was only for research reasons that he had secretly conducted their breeding in the basement of his house. Research that ultimately aimed at the complete extinction of all dinosaurs!
