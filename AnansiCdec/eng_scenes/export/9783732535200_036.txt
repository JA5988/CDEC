They had been on the road for several hours now. At the small town of Fernley, they changed to the famous Interstate 80, which cut through all of America from coast to coast and led from New York to San Francisco. Less than half an hour later they reached the first outskirts of Reno. In the city center, Betty pulled off the interstate, but it took them another nearly hour of asking their way until they finally found Biochemics, the research institute for which Boris Corman worked. There, disappointment awaited them, because when they inquired about Corman, they learned that he had called in sick for the day. "Well, we'll just have to see him at home," Betty commented. "Unless he's really seriously ill, that might actually be an advantage. It's been my experience a few times that it's easier to talk to people in their private surroundings than it is to pull them out of their work." While Michael had talked on the phone before they left with Steve Gardner, who was also at large again and swore on high that he hadn't revealed anything about the record, Betty had talked to Bredham again and had also gotten Corman's home address for good measure.
