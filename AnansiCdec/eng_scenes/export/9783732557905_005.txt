The next morning, Carsten helped put breakfast on the table and get Lilly ready. In exchange, he refrained from reading the morning paper, which was otherwise an important ritual for him. There was nothing like reading about the events of the previous day over a good cup of coffee. But when Marissa came into the store, he helped out with everything. The three of them then drove downtown, where they parked the car in the underground garage under the building that also housed Phillips Toy Paradise. They took the elevator up to the sales floor. The store was still closed, but Carsten's parents and two of the saleswomen were already there. "Grandma, Grandpa!" Lilly ran off and straight into her grandmother's arms, who swung her around. Then grandpa was also greeted effusively. Shortly after, the store opened. The rest of the sales staff had also appeared in the meantime. And already the first customers came into the store. While Lilly was allowed to play in her grandma's office, Marissa set about unpacking and labeling the new merchandise. Later, she would decorate them in the shop windows. But for now, she had to help serve for a while, because the store was full of customers.
