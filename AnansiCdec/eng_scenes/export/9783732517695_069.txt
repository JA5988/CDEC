Kathleen Flaherty arrived in Cork the next day. She made another phone call to Duke Brian. She reached him at the castle. He told her a place by the river where Patrick would come. Duke Brian had not noticed that the door of his study had been opened quietly, that his wife had heard what he had discussed with Kathleen. He left the castle, smuggled Patrick off the estate, and sent him to the river. Then he drove to Cork for a preliminary meeting with his notary. After that meeting, the new will would be drawn up. Tomorrow afternoon Duke Brian would be able to sign it in the presence of two witnesses. The Duke knew that he could no longer live with this woman. He wanted to separate from her. Kathleen and Patrick were in each other's arms. Both of them were unable to speak reasonably. All their sentences ended with confessing their love to each other.
