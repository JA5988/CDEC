And without thinking about it for long, she took leave the next day, drove over to Gotha with Herr and Frau von Schwarzburg, and went to the bank. She deposited the check and gave instructions that five thousand marks be transferred to Magnus Rittner, three thousand to Consul Dreyhaupt, and two thousand to Herr von Schlieben, in the name of her mother, to compensate for a loan received. To Consul Dreyhaupt and to Herr von Schlieben she wanted to write a few more lines of explanation. Magnus Rittner, however, was not to hear from her. She could not write to him. It was enough for him to hear that her mother's debt had been repaid. But now she could think of nothing else but how Magnus Rittner would take this money. Always she saw him before her, as clearly as if she had seen him only yesterday. It was strange - Fred Rittner's image had completely blurred in her memory. But his brother's striking personality had etched itself firmly in her memory. Nor did she think how Fred Rittner would take it that the five thousand marks had been repaid. Only how Magnus Rittner thought about it occupied her incessantly. Would he now think a little more mildly of her mother - and of herself? How would he feel? Had he been at the front, had he fought and suffered? And suddenly a thought made her heart cramp. Was he even still alive? Hadn't the war claimed him as a victim? She trembled, and a strange cold shiver ran over her body.
