As they entered, she caught sight of Magnus Rittner, who had noticed her disappearance. He was leaning against a pillar not far from the door, looking over the glittering company with serious eyes. When he now saw the two young people enter, their faces beaming with happiness, he winced. A slight pallor settled on his prominent features, and his teeth clenched tightly. In the first days since he had met Rosemarie, it had come over him like a sudden, hot joy when her eyes had looked at him so obliviously. But before he, the serious, thorough one, was even clear about his feelings, his brother had also caught fire and was eager for Rosemarie. And she smiled at him and seemed, like everyone, charmed by him. Then Magnus Rittner withdrew into himself with his feelings. And when Fred raved about the beautiful Rosemarie von Salten, he gave himself the appearance of humorous superiority. Fred was allowed to suspect as little as Rosemarie herself what it was like inside him. For he loved his brother and did not want to grieve him. Instinctively he felt now, as the two young people came in from the terrace, that the decision had been made. No one could guess what it looked like inside him as he looked over the company with a motionless face. Only once did the pain in his eyes light up - when they met Rosemary's for a moment. And the young creature flinched under that strange look. She did not understand what the expression in his eyes was supposed to mean, only felt instinctively that Magnus Rittner was suffering. But before she had quite caught his gaze, he turned away and went into one of the empty adjoining rooms. He longed to be away from the loud, cheerful company and wanted to be alone, to come to terms with his pain.
