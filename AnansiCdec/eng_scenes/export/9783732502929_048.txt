How is it, Ellen, can we go to the table?" "We were just waiting for you, Fred." They went to the table and Ellen Rittner really showed herself a little more lively than usual. She even laughed once when Fred told a funny anecdote. He kissed her hand delightedly. "Thank goodness, Ellen, that I can hear you laughing again. I think your new companion is working in advance," he said gleefully. And he had as little idea as his brother who this companion was. The next morning Ellen Rittner left.
