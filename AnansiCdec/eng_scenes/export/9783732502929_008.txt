The two brothers had met Schlieben, Karsten and the other victims of Salten's wife in the bar. And the gentlemen confirmed what Schlieben had said and gave some more details. Fred Rittner listened to all this with a feeling as if he himself had been insulted and humiliated. His love for Rosemarie had already been mixed with a strong dose of indignation. He couldn't shake the feeling that he was being forced to play a ridiculous role in all of this, and that helped him get over the affair more quickly than Magnus had believed. So the brothers took their leave of the gentlemen that same evening. They spoke of important business that called them home. The gentlemen, of course, knew very well that the brothers were leaving only to avoid a more distant encounter with the ladies Salten, but pretended to believe in the pretext. Only Schlieben said quietly to Magnus: "It is very wise that you take your brother away from here. People in love are prone to folly. I hope your brother will soon get over it-he is young, after all." Magnus nodded. And he couldn't help thinking, "Nobody feels sorry for Rosemarie. And she's the one who suffers, after all." But he didn't say that. He just held out his hand to Schlieben. The latter squeezed it warmly. "I hope we will meet again. If I may, I'll look you up on my way home. I'd like to take a look around your plant again." "We will always be glad to welcome you to our home, Herr von Schlieben." "Goodbye, then! And don't be angry with me for having stung your star." "On the contrary, we must be grateful to you." "Well - I was thinking of your father. It was for his sake that I warned you." The brothers immediately made their travel arrangements.
