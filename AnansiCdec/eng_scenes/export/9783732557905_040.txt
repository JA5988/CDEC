Fifteen minutes later, Andrea was walking in the meadows along the Rhine. She let Dolly off the leash and put on her hood, because it had started snowing again. There was also a sensitively cold wind blowing. Dolly didn't mind, of course. She romped around, sniffed exciting tracks and greeted other dogs who were also still walking with their masters. After a while it became too cold for Andrea. Besides, the path lighting was over here. The main path led to one of the parking lots. A meadow path meandered further along the river until it met one of the main paths again. Dolly wasn't thinking of turning back yet, however. She had picked up a particularly interesting trail, which she followed unflinchingly, disobeying her mistress. Surrendered, Andrea walked a little further. It was a good thing she had her flashlight with her. "But not for long," she let the dog know. But Dolly didn't care.
