She went down to Gilda. She had just awakened and was holding out her arms to her. "Good morning, Griseldis!" "Good morning, my heart child! Did you sleep well?" "Yes, very well." "Then let us make haste that you may finish quickly." When, after half an hour, Count Harro entered his daughter's room, Griseldis was just kneeling before Gilda, tying a broad, light-blue sash around her little white embroidered dress. Count Harro looked down with silent joy on these two beloved beings. Was it impossible for him to bind Griseldis to him for life? Was he not allowed to grasp her hand with a pure heart? Was he not a fool to walk quietly beside her with his hot desires? Couldn't he leave it up to her, whether she wanted to become his wife or not? Griseldis had risen from her kneeling position. She raised her eyes to the count and said, a little excited, but forcing herself to calm down: "I would like to ask for a conversation, count. I have a communication to make to you. But it must be done without witnesses-and I don't want it to be done here in the castle." He looked at her inquiringly. She looked decidedly a little pale. "So I will come to the pavilion later. After all, Gilda will have other things to occupy her. Is that all right?" "Yes-that's the way. Thank you."
