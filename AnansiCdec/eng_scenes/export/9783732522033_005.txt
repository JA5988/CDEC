 He went to his chambers. His servant, who had already been in his father's service, was waiting for him here. "Grollmann - I didn't see you down in the hall." "I was expecting the Count up here." "Well, you didn't hear what I said to the others downstairs. So I will repeat it to you: Whoever no longer wants to serve me can leave." The servant, who, in spite of his fifty years, held himself taut and erect like a young man, looked into his pale face. "Surely Herr Graf will not believe that of Grollmann? I serve Herr Graf until he lets me go myself. I know that the Count needs loyal servants now. And woe betide anyone who says a bad word about my lord in my presence - he shall feel my fists." "Do you believe in my innocence, Grollmann?" "As in my own, Count. After all, no man could be trusted if Herr Graf should be capable of committing such a crime." "I thank you, Grollmann! You will probably be the only one who believes in me." "Oh no, Herr Graf. Comtesse Beate also believes in the innocence of Herr Graf. She has told me so. And she has done well here in keeping order and quiet in the absence of the Herr Graf, though she was sick and miserable from all the excitement, and so frightened that it could pity one." "Where is Comtesse Beate? I haven't seen her yet," replied the Count. "Comtesse wants to wait for the Count in the dining room. She didn't want to stand downstairs among the people and will probably want to greet Herr Graf alone first."
