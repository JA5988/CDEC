A few days before her departure came the hour Robert had been waiting for. Kathleen was at the castle. She had arranged to meet Patrick, but he was still delayed at the estate. She used this time to take a walk along the riverbank. Robert followed her. She did not notice him. As she sat down on a willow stump, Robert stepped out of the bushes. Kathleen was startled, but calmed down when she saw that it was only Robert facing her. "Were you afraid of being mugged, Kathleen?" he asked, stepping close in front of her. "Since when have we been on a first-name basis, Duke?" asked Kathleen. Her beautiful face had reddened, there was defense in her eyes. "Since I wish it." Robert reached out his arms and pulled Kathleen to him. He held her so tightly that she couldn't break away. "You are beautiful, Kathleen, you are desirable, you are the kind of woman I want." He wanted to kiss her. Kathleen pulled her head back, her fists pounding against Robert's chest. "Let go of me! What do you think you're doing? I'm Patrick's fiancée!" Duke Robert laughed out loud. Now he managed to kiss Kathleen. He pressed her body against him, his hand reaching into the neckline of her dress. He wanted to pull it over her shoulders. Disgust seized Kathleen before those greedy hot hands, she screamed even louder and struggled desperately. She had more strength than Robert would have given her credit for. He lost his grip, they tumbled to the floor. Robert pressed himself against her. "Patrick's fiancée. I am also a Duke Young of Windhome. I want to possess you. Kathleen, and I will take what I desire." Kathleen's hands braced against Robert. She managed to free herself somewhat from him. She tore herself free, jumped up and ran into the bushes. When she saw Duke Robert bending the branches apart, she continued to flee. Up to the path that led to the castle.
