The following Saturday afternoon Griseldis drove over to Dalheim with Gilda. The comtesse was pampered and caressed from all sides. Ruth, however, occupied herself most with her, and Gilda became warm friends with her. On the way home, she chatted very happily about her new friend Ruth. Today Harro had not waited in Treuenfels for Griseldis' return. Today, after all, Gilda was in her company, and that gave him an excuse to ride out to meet the carriage. At the border path between Treuenfels and Dalheim, he waited on his horse until the carriage came into sight. He rode out to meet it, and as he greeted Gilda, his gaze met Griseldis' eyes with a flash. I have longed for you namelessly, those eyes spoke to her. And she felt with a silent shiver how dear she was to him and how much he loved her. It rose moistly in her eyes with emotion.
