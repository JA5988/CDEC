Late in the afternoon, Duke Patrick Young of Windhome accepted the position of shepherd. He called himself only Patrick Young here, although his papers also noted his title. But in this land of emigrants, that did not attract attention. Once again Patrick postponed the return trip to Ireland, once again he took a run at building a new life for himself, but homesickness tormented him more and more. When he traveled with his large flock of sheep, he took the travel money out of his pocket and held it against the wind. When he received a letter from Kathleen on his twenty-fifth birthday, he tied up his bundle and started the return journey.
