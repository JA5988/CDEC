The afternoon was even more hectic than the morning. And so it would continue until Christmas. Of course, Lilly was again completely in her element. She had set up her store and offered her "customers" things that weren't even there. Of course, Grandpa and Grandma had given her new toys again: one of the new hobby horses, as well as one of the Indian dolls and a picture book. Lilly immediately fell in love with the hobby horse. She rode through the store on it with a loud "Hup, hup", taking a few things with her and bumping into customers. Smiling, they watched her go. In the evening, Lilly wanted to take her new treasures home, but Marissa didn't agree. "Let's leave all this here nicely," she said firmly. "You can play with it when we get back to the store. You'll have plenty of other stuff at home." "But I want to take it home with me!" Defiantly, Lilly wrapped her arms around the hobbyhorse. In her mind, Marissa could already see the little girl riding it from room to room and falling down the stairs. "No," she insisted, "enough is enough." "How can you take away the child's joy?" her mother-in-law interjected. "Really, Marissa, I don't understand you." That's right, you don't understand anything, Marissa was tempted to retort. But she kept her anger in check. "Ellen, Lilly's room is so stuffed with toys that the door barely closes," she offset. "Not to mention that it doesn't make sense from an educational point of view to spoil a child so much with gifts. Lilly can play with them when we get back here." In the meantime, Carsten had also joined them. He took the new book and leafed through it briefly. "She doesn't have that many books," he objected. "I think this one is very nice. Let's take it." Lilly beamed. She had apparently forgotten that she also wanted to take home the hobbyhorse and the new doll. She hugged the book to her chest and demanded that her mother read it to her tonight. Devoutly, Marissa promised her.
