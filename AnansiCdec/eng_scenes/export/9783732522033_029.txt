Griseldis had gone to Gilda when she had left the Count. However, she was still asleep. Griseldis hurried upstairs to her room. She now had to let a few minutes pass in her mind what she had just experienced. She thanked God from the bottom of her heart that He had helped her to lighten the burden that lay on Count Harro's soul a little. And she prayed with fervor for a miracle that would bring his innocence to light. While she was praying with all her fervency for this miracle, she suddenly heard a soft noise. She looked up and was astonished to see that the picture that formed the door to the secret closet was slowly turning on its hinges, so that the closet lay open before her gaze. She jumped up and approached the closet. As she did so, she had a very strange sensation that she could not explain. How could this door have opened by itself? I must know that I have closed it, and the lock closes extremely tightly and well, she thought. Slowly she closed the door. The little dolphin jumped back into the frame with the soft snapping sound. She shook the door. Now it was closed tightly, and it certainly wasn't going to open again on its own. She did not suspect that heaven had wanted to give her a silent hint in which way the requested miracle could have been brought about.
