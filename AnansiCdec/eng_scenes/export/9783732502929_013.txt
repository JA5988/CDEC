Rosemarie was not to have time to give in to her pain. The mother collapsed and fell seriously ill. She had to be put to bed. And Rosemarie was fully occupied with her care. It was almost a relief to her that this care was so exhausting. It distracted her somewhat from her agonizing thoughts. But when her mother occasionally fell into a short slumber, Rosemarie sat dull and miserable in the armchair by her bed, reading Fred Rittner's letter and wondering again and again why Magnus Rittner had refused to consent to his brother's union with her. Deep bitterness filled Rosemary's soul. And she wondered if Fred Rittner had really loved her. How could he, if he really loved her, leave her like that after what had happened between them? She thought of how many sweet and tender words he had had for her last night. But at the same time she remembered that he had spoken lightly of being in love. Yes, with that he had probably spoken the truth, in love he had been with her, but true love he had not felt for her. Otherwise he would not have been able to do that to her, even if the brother demanded it. Rosemarie went through all the agonies of a betrayed love. She felt as if a bitter dishonor had been inflicted on her. Added to this was the lamentation of her mother. It seemed as if she was no less severely affected by this blow than her daughter.
