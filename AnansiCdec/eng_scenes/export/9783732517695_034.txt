A week later, Patrick was called back from Dublin. His mother had died. The sick heart had failed her. Not another word was spoken between father and son about the incident in the study. They stood together by their mother's coffin, joined in grief. Patrick did not doubt that his father's grief was genuine, so he did not reproach him. Alice Murray kept discreetly in the background during the funeral services, but everything proceeded as she had arranged. In this way, she had once again made herself indispensable to Duke Brian.
