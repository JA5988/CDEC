 A few days passed. Griseldis had quickly settled into Treuenfels Castle, and she could have felt completely happy in her new position, if two things had not prevented her from doing so. There was Comtesse Beate's hostile nature and Count Harro's gloomy sadness, which testified to bitter soul pain. It was mainly the latter that hurt her. She would have accomplished the hardest thing if she could have helped him. She did not conceal from herself that she had lost her young heart to him, that she loved him with all the strength and fervor of her soul. With Gilda she was of one heart and soul. The child had attached herself to her with a great intimacy and shared tendernesses only between her and her beloved father. Harro had observed Griseldis keenly and had come to the conclusion that he was fortunate to have found such an understanding and loving governess for his daughter.
