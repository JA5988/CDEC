While Griseldis was giving Gilda writing lessons, she could not command her thoughts. She recalled her dream. In this dream she had been standing on the top of the tower. She had been up there all alone. Suddenly something cool and strange had blown at her, as if someone was standing next to her. She turned around and saw a beautiful blond woman next to her, in whom she immediately recognized Countess Alice. She wore a white robe, her blond braids hung down from her head, and one was looped around her neck like a ribbon. She showed Griseldis a ring and beckoned her to follow. And then Griseldis had walked behind the white figure in her dream, through a stairwell and a room she did not know. Suddenly she found herself in the room she had described to Count Harro, that is, in the Countess's bedroom - her death room, and in her bed lay the Countess. Beside her bed was a bedside cabinet, as in Griseldis's own room, and on this bedside cabinet was a filled wine glass, in which sparkled a reddish golden wine. A hand, which seemed to grow out of the wall above the bedside cabinet, dropped three balls, like mother-of-pearl, into the wine. Then the whole dream image disappeared, and Griseldis felt as if she were floating in the air for a while. She awoke and found herself in her bed. Griseldis was now strangely touched when she heard that the string ring really existed. And she was glad that Count Harro had promised to take her to the tower. She was also glad that she would be allowed to see the Countess's rooms.
