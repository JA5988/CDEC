But her condition worsened rapidly. She got the most terrible heart cramps, and Rosemarie had no time to indulge her gloomy thoughts. Day and night she nursed her sick mother. Mrs. von Salten's inner restlessness aggravated her suffering. She desperately wanted to get well so that she could continue her journey. And she implored her daughter to say yes to Herr von Heinzius when they would meet him. Rosemarie was not of the character to consent to such a union, but she feared to upset her mother even more and said reassuringly that she would consider it. First her mother should get completely well again. Frau von Salten breathed a sigh of relief. Since Rosemarie no longer strictly refused, she was full of hope that everything would go well. But she also felt that it was high time for her to reach a peaceful haven. This grueling life was sapping her strength. And her resources were dwindling at an alarming rate. In the evening of that day, her condition seemed to improve. The pain and shortness of breath subsided, and she hoped to be able to sleep. She did indeed soon fall asleep, and Rosemarie, wrapped in a comfortable morning dress, lay down on the divan to rest for a few hours as well. Tired from the sleepless nights that lay behind her, she too quickly fell asleep.
