 In the meantime, it was one hundred percent certain that no organs had been injured and no consequential damage was to be feared. Although she had temporarily experienced slight cardiac arrhythmias, they had proved to be harmless. There had been no internal bleeding, and no surrounding nerves had been injured. In a few days she could be discharged and at least resume her puppetry. However, she was still forbidden to carry heavy things. For her private performances, she would have to leave the setting up of the stage to her colleague Paul. But that was no problem. They had talked about it during his visit the night before. Paul would take all the heavy lifting off her hands, and with the puppet stage she didn't have to worry about such things anyway. However, Lorena had her problems with the predicted healing time. Only after six to eight weeks would the breastbone be completely healed, as Dr. Meurer had explained to her. During this time, she had to pay close attention to her posture so that the fracture would grow straight together and not form a hump. Unfortunately, it was not so easy to keep a straight posture when playing with dolls. All in all, it would take about half a year before she had no more complaints and was able to bear her full weight again. And that was an awfully long time for Lorena, who was not a very patient person.
