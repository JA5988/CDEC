Rosemarie was now in her new position for the third week. She had not yet found an opportunity to speak with Magnus Rittner alone. He came several times a day to his brother's house and took part in the meals. He also chatted with the ladies for an hour or so. But being alone never happened. A few days ago, there had also been a larger festivity at the house, which Rosemarie had to attend. More gentlemen than ladies were invited, including some business friends of the brothers who had been at the factory for a few days to test Fred's newly invented colors. These gentlemen had also dined at Rittner's house a few times. And they did not know whom to admire more, Frau Ellen or her beautiful companion. At the social evening, Rosemarie, like her mistress, was surrounded by admirers. And so she did not have the hoped-for opportunity to speak with Magnus Rittner alone that evening either. Now the business friends had left again, and the brothers had a little more time again.
