After the burden of wanting to help Alessandra and Julien and not being allowed to help was lifted from Leonie's soul, she enjoyed her life in Hamburg even more. She took on the rest of the Elbchaussee villas and their residents with gusto. These well-researched human stories appealed. The "Nienst√§dter Sonntagsblatt" was suddenly bought, more ads came in, so everything was on the best way. Leonie's popularity grew, and she no longer found closed doors. However, the interviews also had unexpected side effects. She met people who lived in a villa and on an area the size of half a golf course, but in reality lived in squalor. Misery was not necessarily a question of money, but of age. Some of the residents were too old to live alone in these magnificent buildings, in whose entrance hall one could have accommodated a single-family house, or be it that they had really become impoverished in the meantime and did not want to admit it out of pride. As Princess of Wallmenroth, Leonie did have experience with patronizing a charitable organization, collecting donations for a good cause, or attending a charity event in a glittering ball gown at the side of the prince and princess. But taking away the fear of the old people's home, or even finding a place for an old lady who had once been the wife of an ambassador, for example, was beyond Leonie. Just like Dr. Langen, who asked her through the nose to find a private buyer for his valuable Isphahan carpets.
