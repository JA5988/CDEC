The wind of the day had turned into a storm in the evening. It howled around the estate when the people brought Duke Brian's horse. The hunting leaseholder had immediately given him the coup de grace when he discovered the misfortune. The storm also howled around Windhome Castle when Duke Patrick entered it for the first time in months. The constables accompanied him. They wanted to stay in the castle. Duchess Alice's suspicions about Patrick grew stronger by the hour. The notary in Cork confirmed that he had drawn up a new will for Duke Brian. It did not exonerate Patrick that the notary testified that Duke Brian had been very quiet and could hardly have been under pressure. Patrick admitted how long he had been on the estate and why he had returned secretly. Only now did it become apparent what had been the reason for his flight to Australia. No one believed that so much injustice could happen to one man in particular. Patrick stood there as a check forger, girl abuser, and now blackmailer and murderer of his father. In addition, he did not deny that he had left his hiding place two hours before the accident. A farm worker testified that he had seen him near the scene of the accident. And he went further. He claimed to have observed Patrick with a rake and shovel. The two tools were found near the pit, hidden under moss and branches, that very evening.
