One evening, as he stood silent and lonely in his villa by the window, looking out, as he often did, at the windows of Rosemary's room, he asked himself, "Now, if she really loved you, what would you do? Would you have the courage to hold her, against all odds, she-the daughter of an adventuress?" And he threw back his head with shining eyes. "Yes - yes, I would hold her, for she is blameless and pure, and her love would make me the happiest of mortals. Only in her do I find the completion of my self." And since that evening it was certain with him not to let Rosemarie go away without asking her if she loved him.
