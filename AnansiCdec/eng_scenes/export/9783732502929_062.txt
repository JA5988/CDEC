When she had finished this work, she went down to Mrs. Ellen. She promenaded with her in the beautiful, large park and brought it upon herself to chat seemingly cheerfully and harmlessly with the young woman. Mrs. Ellen grew more and more cheerful. And she said warmly, slipping her hand into Rosemarie's arm, "I am so glad you are with me, Miss Rosemarie. You are so dear and sympathetic to me, and in your presence the evil, gloomy thoughts will no longer torment me. Surely I will now become quite healthy and happy again." Rosemarie said bravely, "Most certainly you will become healthy and happy again. You are so young - and rich and happily married. That's how enviable your fortune seems to me." Mrs. Ellen's eyes shone. "Yes, you are right, I am almost ashamed of you. How bravely, on the other hand, you bear your heavy lot!" Rosemarie smiled strangely. "Bravely? O no, madam, I am very little brave. I am always very much afraid of all adversity that concerns me. I can only do one thing - keep still." "That is bravery, too. I have not wanted to keep still and have rebelled against fate. And in doing so, I completely forgot what valuable goods it still left me. But now I remember and want to be grateful. And you should also revive and become happy here with us." Rosemarie was deeply moved. "You are so good, madam, I thank you with all my heart." So the two ladies chatted, and Rosemarie thought wistfully how wonderful life could have been for her here if she had been allowed to stay. But fate was not so kind to her.
