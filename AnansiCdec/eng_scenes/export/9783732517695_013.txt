It was not until lunch that Stella met with Duchess Alice and her son. Both behaved very reservedly towards her, but without being unfriendly. As Stella was about to leave the dining room with Emily, Duke Robert said, "I have heard that the position of shepherd has been filled in the meantime and Mister Donald has no work. I am looking for harvesters for my estate and would hire him immediately. He would only have to go to the steward. Will you please order him to do so, Miss Stella?" "I will do that." Stella quickly left the dining room. That evening she told Patrick of Duke Robert's offer, but immediately added, "I wouldn't go to the Windhome estate." "Why not?" asked Patrick. "Any work must suit me at present." "I would prefer that we move to another area, Patrick. As much as I like our little house here, I'd leave it if we could settle down somewhere else." Patrick looked at her in amazement. "Have you become so anxious, Stella? We want to get married in four weeks in that little church by the river. That's the very church you chose." "I'd do without that, too." "I don't understand you, Stella. So far you've talked me out of the idea that we might be in danger here. You didn't want to disappoint Emily and get behind the mystery that surrounds young Duchess Gwendolin." "Yes, I wanted all that," said Stella, agonized. "But ever since you were ambushed in the shepherd's cart, I have been uneasy. I just kept it from you while you were sick." Stella leaned against Patrick. "I'm scared for you. You're the closest to me, you and our happiness. In exchange, I'd give up trying to help Emily and her mother. I would probably be powerless anyway. Duchess Alice often strikes me as the woman in black at Ferrymoore." This time it was Patrick who had to reassure Stella. He did it with such firm and sure words that she complied with his wish to stay in the little house by the river.
