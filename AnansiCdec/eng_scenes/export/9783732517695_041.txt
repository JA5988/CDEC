Patrick had been at Windhome for two months when his father adopted Robert. Again Duke Brian placated his son, "The heir to Windhome remains you, Patrick." "Though there is now a second Duke Young of Windhome, Father? One older than me by five years at that? According to our family's inheritance laws, the eldest son takes possession." "That doesn't apply if this son was adopted, Patrick. You have nothing to worry about. I will remember Robert in my will, but my successor will be only you. How can you even entertain the thought that I might disadvantage you? You are my biological son. I just wanted to make Robert's life a little easier." Duke Brian's voice grew quieter. "And it was his mother's wish." Patrick broke off this conversation. Again it pained him to have to witness his father doing everything his wife asked of him. For the first time, Patrick worried about the power a woman could have over a man. Now he feared even more not to choose the right woman one day.
