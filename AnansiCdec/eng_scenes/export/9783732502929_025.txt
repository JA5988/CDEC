Completely distraught and depressed, she returned to the boarding house with the Countess. The old lady looked at her anxiously from the side while continuing to work on her plan to take advantage of Rosemary's embarrassment. She was enough of a judge of character to realize that Rosemary's desperation was genuine. The experienced old lady pretty much looked into this matter and assumed that Rosemary's mother had probably worn the fake jewelry to raise her credit and had known very well that it was fake. In any case, she liked Rosemarie exquisitely. She was decidedly an innocent, inexperienced creature, and her destitution would put her in a helpless position. Countess Rosenberg wanted to take advantage of that. Rosemary's heart was filled with a hot fear for the future. Since the jewelry was fake, she now stood there completely penniless. What was actually to become of her? The old lady said encouragingly, "Try to calm down first and come to terms with the facts. When you have calmed down, visit me in my room. In the meantime, I want to think about how you will be helped." Rosemarie kissed her withered hand. "I thank you for your participation, Countess. You are right, I need to gather my thoughts first. There has been a bit of a lot rushing at me lately, and I am quite miserable about what I have now had to experience today. It's not just the knowledge that I'm penniless that shakes me - I still can't believe that my mother wore fake jewelry." "Well, well, there are some who wear false jewelry that don't show it. So - when you are calmer, come to me!" They parted.
