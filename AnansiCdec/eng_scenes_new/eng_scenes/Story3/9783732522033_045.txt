The next day Griseldis went to Dalheim. Count Harro had promised to take care of his little daughter himself, so that Griseldis could stay without worries as long as she wanted. In Dalheim she was received with hearty joy. Ruth already ran to meet her and hung on her neck, and then the others all came and surrounded her. She was also introduced to Baroness Dalheim. She took a liking to Griseldis and inquired lively about little Gilda. "You must bring the child to me next time, Fr√§ulein von Ronach," she asked.
