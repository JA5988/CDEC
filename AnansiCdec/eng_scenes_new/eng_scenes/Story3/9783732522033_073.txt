 On September 20, Griseldis von Ronach and Count Harro Treuenfels were quietly married. The Sarnow family, the Baron and his mother, Aunt Agnes and Mother Anna were present as guests. A great many heartfelt congratulations were received. From all sides, the renegade friends and acquaintances sought to show Count Harro how happy they were to know him blameless. They had all joined in these weeks, had tried their best to make up for the fact that they had stayed away when Count Harro's innocence had not yet been clearly proven.
