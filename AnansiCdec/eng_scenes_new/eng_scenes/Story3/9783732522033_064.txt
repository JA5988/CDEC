 When he reached home, he jumped off his horse. His first question was for Fräulein von Ronach. But no one had seen her. Nowhere did he find a trace of her. The restlessness in him grew stronger and stronger. He knocked on the door to the Countess's rooms. Beate seemed to be fast asleep. Or did she just not want to open it for him, not to see him? So he went downstairs again. He met Berta and ordered her to look in Fräulein von Ronach's room to see if she might have left a letter. Berta hurried to Griseldis's room and then reported to the Count, "Fräulein von Ronach cannot have left the house with the intention of going far away; she has not even put on a hat or put on a coat. Her things are all still there." Involuntarily, the count breathed a sigh of relief. But the relief did not last long. Where was Griseldis? He racked his brain. And then he remembered the tower. Was she perhaps there - had an accident happened to her there? As he walked and stood, he ran over to the tower. But he found the door locked. So she was not in the tower. So he went back into the castle.
