Right after breakfast, he took a walk with Gilda. Her sweet chatter brightened his gloomy countenance a little. When he returned from his walk with Gilda today, he handed the child over to Countess Beate and went to his study. There he first wrote to Mother Anna that he agreed to the employment of Fr√§ulein von Ronach. He thanked her warmly for her efforts and asked her to deliver an enclosed letter to the young lady. In this letter to Griseldis von Ronach he wrote: Dear Madam! Through the mediation of the Domina of St. Mary's Abbey, you have been considered as a governess for my daughter. I am convinced that Mother Anna has made an excellent choice, and I ask you to accept this office. However, before you enter my house, I want to point out to you myself, although Mother Anna has already done so, that you will come to the house of a man who must live as an outlaw with all who belong to him. You, too, may have to suffer. I ask you to consider this. If you still want to be a loving, understanding governess to my child, I will be very grateful to you and ask you to take up your position as soon as possible. Please, let me know the date of your arrival so that I can send a car to the station to receive you. I commend myself to you. Count Harro Treuenfels In response to this letter, Griseldis had informed him that she would arrive at Treuenfels Castle next Monday. She had indicated to him the train she intended to use.
