When she arrived at the tower, she took another careful look around. All around, everything was quiet and deserted. She quickly unlocked the door and leaned it behind her so that its wide open position would not betray the fact that she was in the tower. With a sure grip, she now found the painted dolphin. Griseldis stepped into the hollow space. She wanted to fold down the bottom of the closet first before she put in a chair she could climb on. She shone her flashlight up to find the snap lock. And when the flap fell down, she lowered her arms and was now about to step out of the cavity into the room to get a chair. At the same moment she suddenly saw Beate rushing across the room toward her, her face distorted and her eyes glowing madly. With a silent cry of fear, Griseldis backed away from her, into the hollow. Then, with all her might, the comtesse threw the heavy, filled double door into the lock - Griseldis was trapped in the narrow cavity. With hate-filled eyes and an almost insane laugh, the Comtesse was still banging her fist on the door. "Now you will be quiet, blonde witch, now spy on. Now we are even!" she gritted out between her teeth, then she slipped out of the tower room and down the stairs. Carefully, she peeked through the ajar door of the tower first. No one had noticed her before, and no one noticed her now as she stepped out and locked the tower. She threw the key in a wide arc into the dense broom bushes. There it might lie until doomsday. With rigid calmness, she took a detour back to the castle.
