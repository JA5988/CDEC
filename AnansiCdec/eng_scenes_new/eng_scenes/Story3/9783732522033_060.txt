 Griseldis, leaving the library, had rushed to her rooms first. The fear of Beate was so strong in her soul that it shook her. And she felt as if she had to hurry to finish her mission, so that she could then take refuge in Count Harro's protection. Longing was in her to rest in his arms and let him protect and guard her. - She could only bring true, full happiness to the man she loved if he could walk beside her as a free man. And therefore she had to finish her work first. It drove her over to the tower. She wanted to find out whether it was possible, standing on a chair, to reach the door to the closet in the hollow space, open it, and reach with her hands into the countess's room. If she had certainty about this, she would rather tell Count Harro everything and investigate further together with him. She put the flashlight to her and hurried out. She didn't have much time left, because Gilda would soon wake up. But she didn't need much time. In a quarter of an hour she could have finished her research. No one met her on the way.
