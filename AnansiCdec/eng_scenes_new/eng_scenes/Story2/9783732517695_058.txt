An hour later, Patrick left the castle. He had everything with him that he needed to go abroad. His father had insisted that he leave immediately. And for Patrick, there was no choice. He knew people would testify against him, they would bring up more girls to testify that he should have defiled them. Duke Brian had given Patrick no more opportunity to defend himself, and had also dismissed in sharp terms his suggestion that Duke Robert must be pursuing the local girls. That he had assaulted Kathleen was not evidence for Duke Brian. Robert had had an alibi for that time. Patrick had to leave the castle in a roundabout way. Already in front of the gate there were men, and again and again he recognized guards. Only in a remote place did he dare to order a cab.
