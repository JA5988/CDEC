Patrick was often careless during these weeks and spent his money generously. There was only one thing he made sure of: that he kept enough to pay for the return trip. Often he was close to making it. Especially when he held a letter from Kathleen in his hands. She always wrote of her love for him, even though her studies were not lacking in her reports. For a very long time yet, Patrick would have to do without living with Kathleen. She would not finish her studies for another two years. At home he would not have minded, she would still have become his wife, but now he should have to wait so long? Restlessness finally drove Patrick to Queensland, where he worked in a silver mine. This hard and for him unfamiliar life chafed him even more. He didn't make friends because he was bitter and didn't make a move on anyone. In the evening, when the others were drinking, playing cards or getting girls, Patrick would sit in a lonely place and stare at his traveling money.
