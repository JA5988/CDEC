Before Patrick went to bed, he stood on the terrace and thought of that time in Australia's history when men had been allowed to take prisoners from the penal colonies because of the shortage of women on that continent. They had often made good wives for their husbands. Patrick looked at the second wicker chair on the terrace. It was used only on the rare occasion when business visitors came. Every evening a beautiful young woman might sit in that wicker chair, Patrick thought, facing me. A woman who waits for me when I am out and about, a woman who is happy to have found a home and security, a woman who shares my life and gives me love. He looked up at the starry sky, and suddenly he said, "I'm taking you to me, Sally."
