 *** Alice Murray did not fall for this thought either. When she quietly became Duchess Alice six months later, she had other things on her mind than winning the love of her stepson. She suggested that he address her by her first name. He did not let it be known whether he would make use of it. He knew it would take him a long time to get used to the fact that this woman now belonged entirely to his father. Robert Murray had not hoped in vain that his mother would be more generous after her marriage. She now had a lot of money at her disposal. Even more so since she also helped her husband with the bills. It did not occur to him to check her work. There was only one thing he objected to: that Robert spent most of his time idly wandering around the castle. He had even given up his job as a tennis coach. It was no longer necessary for him to earn money. And his mother had held out the prospect that he would soon be very well respected. She was going to persuade her husband to adopt her son. Then he would be Duke Robert Young of Windhome. Robert still felt almost giddy when he imagined that. But not his mother. No goal was too high for her, and she went coldly calculatingly toward it. She could also always placate her husband when he reproached her that Robert was stealing the day from the Lord God. Everyone in the neighborhood knew that Duchess Alice now ran the regiment at Windhome. People got used to going to her with all their requests. The fact that she did not have an open ear for many requests and always decided only to her advantage did not induce anyone to try his luck with Duke Brian now. In a short time the duke had lost his prestige, he played only an extra role next to his wife. But that did not seem to bother him. She still held him captive in her nets, she still made an effort to win him over. He did not feel how annoying this often became for her.
