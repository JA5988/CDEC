On one of these evenings, Patrick disappeared from the camp. He no longer wanted to work in the silver mine, he was drawn out into the countryside. In the morning he came to a larger town. Her name was Mary Kathleen. As if spellbound, Patrick stopped. His eyes could not tear themselves away from the sign on the outskirts of town. "Mary Kathleen!" he said so loudly that a passerby stopped and said, "Yes, you are in Mary Kathleen. A large piece of land behind our town bears the same name. Didn't you know that? Are you a stranger here?" "Yes," Patrick replied. "Are you looking for work?" The man looked at the small bundle Patrick held in his hand. It was the only thing he had left of what little luggage he had. "Yes, I'm looking for work. But I don't want to stay in the city." "Then go out to the country, the sheep farmers are always looking for help. No one needs to stay without work in Australia, and certainly not in Queensland." Patrick thanked the man, walked through town, and then took a motor coach out to the country. Now only one thing was going through Patrick's mind: he had come by chance to a town called Mary Kathleen. Was that supposed to be a good omen, hearing the names of his mother and the love of his life every day?
