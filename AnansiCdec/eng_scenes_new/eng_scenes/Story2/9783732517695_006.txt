When Stella returned to the little house by the river in the early evening, she longed to be able to talk to Patrick, even though they had just separated this morning. She was anxious to tell him what Gwendolin had said. Especially about her warning about the wind around the castle, Patrick should know. Stella decided to go and see him. She didn't mind that she had a long walk ahead of her. She imagined Patrick's delight when she suddenly knocked on the shepherd's cart. Just today, Patrick would not be expecting her yet. Hopefully his shepherd dogs Fluffy and Lucy wouldn't betray her as soon as she got near the pen. They were her friends too and would surely greet her enthusiastically. As Stella walked along the river, it was already getting dark. But she knew the area, and soon the moon would rise.
