In order to find out from his father exactly what the doctors said about his mother's condition, he wanted to visit him one evening in his study. Duke Brian often sat there for half the night. He not only had to do written work for the estate, but also for associations and foundations that he presided over on an honorary basis. Patrick had never been used to knocking on the door of the study when he wanted to visit his father. Today, too, he opened the door immediately. At the same moment a sharp cry sounded in the room. Alice Murray had emitted it. Duke Brian had held her in his arms. Now he was standing in his place with his head on fire, while the lady of the house pushed past Patrick and fled from the room. Patrick had turned deathly pale. For a long time he had to search for words, then he said, "No, you're not an old man yet at fifty, Father. But where do you get the right to cheat on my mother?" "I do not deceive her." Duke Brian threw himself into an armchair. "We seem to disagree on that, Father. But I'm sure it's not a generational problem, it's a character thing." Patrick ran out of the room, slamming the door behind him.
