He flinched, startled. A hand had come to rest on his shoulder. He turned around. Behind him stood Duchess Gwendolin. She was deathly pale and her eyes were red with tears. "Patrick, I testified that Father had reconciled with you, but no one believes me. Robert and my mother-in-law claim that I often speak confused things now in my condition. You must flee, you must not be arrested. Your father wouldn't bear that. I am acting for him, I am helping you. Quick, they are coming back." She wrenched open the door to the next room and thrust a wad of bills into his hand. "I'll stop the constables, I'll lure them to my room. In the meantime, you must succeed in leaving the castle. God bless you, Patrick." Gwendolin ran through the next room. In the corridor stood the constables. Gwendolin swayed and cried out softly. Immediately, the constables jumped to her and supported her. "Please, take me to my room," Gwendolin begged, holding onto the two men. "I think I need a doctor." In her room, she leaned against the door and could not be persuaded by the constables to sit down. She wanted to prevent even one of them from leaving the room. Her condition aroused understanding. She succeeded in restraining the men for some time from going into Duke Brian's study. When they entered it, the man they were to guard until the warrant arrived had disappeared.
