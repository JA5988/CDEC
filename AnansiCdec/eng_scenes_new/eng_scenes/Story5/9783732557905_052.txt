Lorena drove her car into a parking space and got out. She was overcome with sadness again today, as she always was when she came to the Elisabeth Hospital for outpatient physical therapy. She had not seen Theo since that day shortly before her discharge, when he had kissed her so tenderly. He had not come to see her again, and he had not tried to contact her in any other way. He visited me only out of a sense of guilt, she realized painfully. Even if he had not been to blame for the accident, he might have felt obligated to check on her. After she had gotten better, he had considered his visits superfluous. The flirtations and his kiss had been just a nice gimmick for him. It hurt, because from Lorena's side it had been much more. She would not be able to forget Theo and his kiss so quickly either. I'll survive, she thought with a deep sigh. She just wished she didn't have to come to Elisabeth Hospital for physical therapy anymore. Lorena crossed the entrance hall and walked down the corridor to the new annex, where the treatment rooms for outpatient therapies were located. A dark blonde doctor was just stepping out of one of the doors. "Hello, Dr. Bergen," Lorena called out. "Oh, Mrs. Werding!" The emergency doctor greeted her in her nice way. "Are you still coming here for physical therapy?" "Yes, until the middle of January. I'll have to continue the exercises at home for a while longer, though." "And how are you doing in the meantime?" inquired Dr. Bergen. "Are you still in pain?" "Occasionally." Lorena grimaced. "Of course, I can't take it easy like I should. But my sternum seems to be growing back together straight. I feel it every day for a bump, but there's nothing there." "Great, then there doesn't seem to be any complications." The two women chatted some more and then continued on their way in different directions.
