Suddenly, Lilly's head sank to the side as if she had fallen asleep. Or had she lost consciousness? Andrea resolutely took out her cell phone and dialed the number of the rescue center. She briefly explained the case and indicated which of the parking lots for hikers in the Rhine meadows she would wait at with the sick child. He was to be taken to Elisabeth Hospital. There was certainly no one left in the toy paradise at this time, and Andrea did not know the private number. So she called the police, where she learned that a missing person's report had already been filed for little Lilly Phillips. They would notify the family immediately. Andrea whistled for Dolly, who fortunately came running. With the child in her arms, she made her way to the trailhead parking lot.
