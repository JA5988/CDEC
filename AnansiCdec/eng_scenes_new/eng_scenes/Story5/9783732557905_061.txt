Hand in hand, they strolled through the neighborhood, looking at the windows and front yards already decorated for Christmas. Both were heartily pleased at how well things had turned out. A first rapprochement had already taken place between Theo and his parents. Surely there would soon be a final reconciliation. "Soon it will be Christmas," Marissa remarked softly. "Suddenly the world looks wonderful again. When I think of the despair of the last few weeks ..." Carsten put his arm around her shoulders. "We, too, should stop thinking about the past and rejoice in what the present brings us," he said seriously. "And look forward to the best Christmas present in the world - a healthy daughter." Marissa leaned her head against his shoulder. "It will be as if Lilly has been reborn to us." And she sent a prayer to heaven that the transplant would indeed turn out well.
