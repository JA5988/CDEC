Marissa drove home in good spirits. It had become late. There was a light on in the house, so Carsten was already there. She couldn't wait to tell him about her meeting with Theo. "You come home empty-handed?" noted Carsten in wonder as she entered the hallway. "Didn't you find anything suitable during your shopping trip?" Marissa smiled mysteriously. "Found something much more important, namely Theo, your brother. He's willing to donate his bone marrow to Lilly." She told about how she had tracked Theo down and met him at the highway rest stop. Carsten was too stunned to say anything back. He just swallowed a few times, then took Marissa tightly in his arms and pressed his face into her hair.
