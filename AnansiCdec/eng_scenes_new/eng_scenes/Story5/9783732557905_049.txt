Finally, the infections were brought under control. The fever subsided, Lilly regained her appetite and became livelier with each passing day. Finally, she was allowed to leave the isolation tent, and two more days later she could be transferred to the normal pediatric ward. "Things are looking up," Marissa said happily. Finally, they were allowed to be with their little one more often and to hold her as well. But the main problem was still not solved. A new infection, even if it was harmless for other children, could cost Lilly her life if her neutropenia was not treated immediately. Fortunately, nothing stood in the way of that now. Transfusions of granulocytes were started first. As supportive measures, Dr. Gellert ordered additional administration of vitamins, antibiotics and glucocorticoids. Things settled down quite well during the first few days. Lilly was an amazingly brave and patient patient who was always in a good mood despite everything. She often chattered incessantly, and when she felt like it, she sang her entire repertoire of songs that she had learned. "I'll hire you as a singer for my Punch and Judy show," said Siggi Baumg√§rtner, who was also very fond of the little girl, and Lilly was thrilled. She had also been allowed to watch his Punch and Judy show a few times. But then there was no success. The doctors in the children's ward were shocked to discover that the degeneration of Lilly's white blood cells was continuing - at an alarming rate.
