The next day, there was quite a commotion in the children's ward. Everyone was eagerly awaiting the Christmas party, the little patients as well as the doctors and nursing staff. Of course, the parents were also invited. In Lilly's case, it was not clear until the very end whether she should be allowed to attend. Although the stem cell transplant was successful and new blood cells were formed from the transplanted stem cells, the risk of infection was still very high. She no longer had to be in the isolation tent, but she had been given a single room. "If you want your daughter to attend the Christmas party, we have to give her additional antibiotics, which I don't like to do," senior physician Doris Gellert told the parents, who had just returned to check on Lilly. "Also, we have to be careful to maintain very strict hygiene. So please, no hugs and kisses." Indecisively, Marissa and Carsten looked at each other. They were not in favor of additional antibiotics either, but Lilly had been looking forward to this celebration for so long, especially the puppet show. She had gotten really angry when she had been told that she had to get healthier first. She wanted to go in any case, she had said, even if she was still very ill. "I'm afraid we'll have to allow her to go," Marissa finally said, and Carsten nodded in agreement.
