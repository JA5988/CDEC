And that same day, Frau von Salten spoke to her daughter about this matter. Mother and daughter were sitting on the balcony in the shade, dressed in fragrant white dresses, and looking out into the sunlit landscape. Beyond the hotel garden, on the street, colorful life flooded. Frau von Salten tore her eyes away from the colorful picture and said, breathing a sigh of relief, "Do you know from whom I received a letter, Rosemarie?" The young lady turned her pale, sad face to her mother. "From whom, Mama?" "From your most faithful admirer, Herr von Heinzius. Here, you can read it." Apathetically Rosemarie read the letter and returned it without remarking anything about it. "Well, Rosemarie, isn't this loyal love touching? Won't you seek healing for your pains from this good-natured, understanding man? He would adore you, carry you on his hands. And he is quite a handsome man. Give him your consent, Rosemarie!" The young lady looked at her mother with wide eyes. Around her pale lips it twitched like restrained pain. "You can't be serious, mama." "Yes, child, I am serious. Take the hand that is offered to you! You don't want to mourn this unhappy inclination forever, do you?" Rosemarie rose abruptly. "It is not yet two weeks, mamma, since Fred Rittner departed. Everything is sore and aching inside me. Do you really think I could make up my mind now to say yes to another man? I shall never be able to trust any man again." "Don't be foolish! Heinzius does not demand heaven-defying love. He is content if you will let him spoil you." Rosemary's face twitched in restrained agony. "Please, please, don't speak of it, Mama, you torment me namelessly! I can't speak of it." There was such anguish in her words that her mother told herself it was premature to penetrate her further now. And when Rosemarie asked her to allow her to promenade in the garden for half an hour, she gave her permission.
