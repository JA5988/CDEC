Rosemarie spent the days until her mother's funeral in dull mourning. When it was over, however, all kinds of life's necessities rushed in on her. There were many things to think about and take care of. The boarding house owner presented the bill first and foremost, and with great lamentation she demanded the cost of a new bed and wallpaper for the room. "Otherwise I won't rent again the room where a guest died, Signorina, I can't expect anyone to sleep in the same bed," she assured, calling all the saints. Rosemarie saw that this demand was justified. She paid the tongue-tied lady. After that, she was left with only a small amount of cash, about two hundred marks. But that did not worry her. She knew that her mother's precious jewelry was safe in the jewelry box. She had had to take the key from her dead mother's neck. She wore it constantly on a chain under her clothes. Rosemarie had not yet opened the box. Even if her mother had not wanted to part with the jewelry during her lifetime, Rosemarie could now, as she believed, dispose of it with a calm heart in order to keep the worries of life at bay. Her mother could no longer wear it. How much the jewelry was worth, she did not know to estimate. But the proceeds had to bring her a small fortune, enough for her to live on in modest circumstances. For the time being, she wanted to sell only one of the pieces of jewelry to get money for her onward journey to Germany. Where she wanted to go, she did not know yet. But if she sold the piece of jewelry, she wanted to have the entire jewelry appraised at once, so that she could see what she had left. Her mother's pension expired with her death, and she had to rely on the proceeds of the jewelry.
