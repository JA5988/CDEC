When they then came to Partenkirchen, where they met with the Countess's friend, Rosemarie had a few days more to herself and breathed a sigh of relief. But the Countess then seemed to throw the salary for the companion out the window, and she gave her plenty of sewing work not only for herself, but also for her friend, who also took advantage of Rosemarie's skill. Thus Rosemarie had to perform the services of a chambermaid, a seamstress and a companion. Often she had to play the piano and sing on social evenings in the hotel. The countess then collected thanks and applause for her. So Rosemarie was glad when the Countess finally prepared to go home. In Alteichen she hoped to be less strained. Even before the ladies left for Alteichen, all sorts of rumors were buzzing around in the air. There was talk of an impending war, but no one really believed it.
