Magnus Rittner and his brother Fred had really been in the field for years. They had alternately taken leave of absence to keep an eye on things at the ink factory. Business had not always gone smoothly during the long war years. But in the end, everything was back on track. After the armistice, both brothers had returned home for good and were now hard at work. They used all their strength to bring the business back to its former height. Fred Rittner had married Baroness Reinsberg two years ago, when he was home on extended leave, and now lived with her in a newly built villa situated in a large park near the plant. Magnus Rittner still occupied his parents' villa, which was only a few minutes away from that of his brother. Magnus frequented his brother's house a lot and usually took his meals there. He was still unmarried. Fred Rittner had long forgotten Rosemarie von Salten. She had been only an episode in his life, and he had given her several more successors in his heart before the beautiful Baroness Reinsberg captured his flighty heart. Magnus Rittner had become even more silent and withdrawn during the difficult war years. No woman had been able to become dangerous to him since then. The events of the war and his strenuous activity did not leave him much time at all. But in rare quiet hours, a fine girl's head appeared again and again in his mind's eye. He then saw Rosemarie von Salten quite clearly before him, with a sweet, heart-moving smile around her pale red, beautifully drawn mouth. That was how he remembered Rosemarie von Salten, and her image came uncalled when he could only rest for a while. He had never been able to forget her, however quickly Fred had finished remembering her. And often he had wondered, full of anxiety, what might have become of her.
