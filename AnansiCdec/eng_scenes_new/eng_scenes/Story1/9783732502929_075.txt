And when the young couple left the wedding table, Magnus led his young, beautiful wife into his newly refurbished villa. With a devout feeling of happiness, Rosemarie strode at her husband's side through the rooms, which had been furnished in a wedding-like manner. "Now at last I have found a home after my own heart, my beloved husband. I want to thank you for it with every breath," she said fervently. Magnus pulled his young wife tightly to him. "Thank me by your love, my Rosemarie, and by making you feel happy in your new home. For your happiness is mine." And their lips found each other in a long, intimate kiss.
