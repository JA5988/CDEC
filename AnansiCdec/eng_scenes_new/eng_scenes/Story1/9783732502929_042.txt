When she was alone in her room, she took out the notebook and thought about whom she should return the money to, besides Magnus Rittner. She picked out Herr von Schlieben and a Consul Dreyhaupt. Fortunately, she knew the addresses of these two gentlemen. Schlieben got two thousand marks, Dreyhaupt three thousand. A deep, liberating breath lifted her chest. Gottlob gottlob - Magnus Rittner got his money back, and towards him she could feel freer again. All these years the thought had weighed heavily on her that she would probably never be able to free herself from this debt. Now, suddenly, a kind fortune threw this sum into her lap. A hot prayer of thanks flew up to heaven.
