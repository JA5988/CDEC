Frau von Schwarzburg was sitting with her friend Ellen on the terrace of her pretty villa. The ladies had laughed about pension memories. Ellen Rittner had really become considerably more lively these days, since she was staying with her friend. In the course of the conversation, Frau von Schwarzburg said, "So today you will meet Fr√§ulein von Salten. She wants to introduce herself to you today. For the first few days I didn't want her to come, you should first liven up a bit. I sent my car to Alteichen to have her picked up, and she will arrive soon." "I'm really looking forward to seeing how I like her." The friends now chatted of other things until they heard the car drive up.
