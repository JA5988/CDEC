The engagement was indeed celebrated, and the one who was most astonished about it was Paul von Bierow. Wolfram Prince von Wallmenroth had only given his wife an extremely astonished look when the unexpected couple Alessandra - Julien presented themselves and then Leonie and Paul. Madame de Fornac, the prince's aunt, who was present, almost slipped the sherry glass out of her hand. During the entire festive dinner, Paul had expected Leonie to suddenly push back her chair and leave the room in tears. But he apparently didn't know his Leonie yet. She was pale, but her chin was vigorously thrust forward. She joined in the table conversation, ate something, drank little, and seemed to be animated by an iron will not to let anything show at any cost. It was only when Alessandra told them that from now on they would live for six months in the south of France at Sablemer Castle and then for six months in Munich, if Julien's business went as planned, that Leonie's body began to tremble. She clutched Paul's hand as if it were the saving straw. To give his bride confidence, Paul returned the squeeze. When he looked up, he could have sworn that Alessandra was watching her sister with the look of a cat lying in wait. Speechless at so much malice, Paul almost failed to respond to the prince's question. Wolfram von Wallmenroth had just beckoned to him and declared that he would be pleased about his daughter's election and would welcome a private meeting tomorrow - perhaps around eleven. Paul nodded, although it surprised him that anyone in this circle took the engagement seriously. After all, he had only wanted to do a chivalrous service to his adored little princess, to spare her the humiliation.
