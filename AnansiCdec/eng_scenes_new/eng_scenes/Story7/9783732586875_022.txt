Her knees were still weak when she let go of the washroom door and stepped into the foyer of the country inn. A man sat at the long wooden counter with his back to her. He was tall and wearing the suit she had recommended this morning as the proper wardrobe for a gathering among shipowners. The man turned around. It was Paul. He looked pale and serious, but smiled at the sight of her and came toward her. "I'm glad you're here already! I've come straight from Cuxhaven," he began, taking her arm. "Alessandra sent me because Julien has some financial problems to deal with. Have you guys eaten yet? I wanted to have a drink first to get some distance from today's negotiations." He squeezed her arm. "How are you?" "G...good." Her heart pounded hard. With disappointment, but also with relief. She returned the pressure of his arm and looked up at him. "Steadfast as the Rock of Gibraltar," Julien had once said of Paul, and Leonie remembered it because today Paul seemed tall and like he was made of granite. Like someone you could rely on, but whose patience you shouldn't try too hard. How fortunate that Paul had no idea what tonight was really about! "Are you glad I came?" he asked in a strangely insistent voice. "Of course," she replied lightly at first. And then she added a "yes" and realized she really meant it.
