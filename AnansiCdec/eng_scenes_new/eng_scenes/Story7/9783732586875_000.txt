"Finally, he's coming!" Leonie von Wallmenroth leaned far out the window. Back there, where a century ago the suitor for her great-grandmother's hand had come riding up the old tree-lined avenue on horseback, Leonie could now see the silver sports car flashing in the sun. He was really coming! Julien de Sablemer, the man everyone liked, loved and adored. The man with the best looks, the most perfect manners, the most charming nature - and he was coming to ask the prince for her hand in marriage. Leonie had never felt so radiant and fabulous. From today on, everyone would know about her happiness!
