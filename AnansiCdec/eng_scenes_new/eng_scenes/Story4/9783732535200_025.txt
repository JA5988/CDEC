Michael gazed after her for a few seconds before turning and strolling toward the glass door that separated the foyer from the restaurant. He still didn't know what fate had actually brought him together with Betty Sanders, but he was more than grateful for it. Her name, that of this hotel, and her room number had been on the million-year-old horn plate. Without much hope, he had come here, learned that she was actually staying here for a few days, and told her the whole crazy story. As could hardly be expected otherwise, she had been extremely skeptical, but at least she had listened to him and had not immediately thrown him out. In the end, he had even been able to convince her that the characters were indeed from prehistoric times. She had taken him to her interview with Professor Schneider, and everything else had fallen into place. From the first moment, Michael had liked her. He was attracted by her self-assurance and inner strength. Moreover, Betty was pretty, intelligent and worldly, but more importantly, he got along well with her. He had often found that he could hardly exchange more than a few words with women he liked on the outside, because they had no common interests and therefore not much to say to each other. With Betty it was quite different. He had to admit to himself that he was well on the way to falling in love with her.
