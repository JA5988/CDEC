Betty sat silently behind the wheel of her Rover. She hadn't spoken much all morning, and neither had Michael. Most of all, they had avoided talking about the previous night. As one would expect, she was really embarrassed. Michael kept throwing her furtive sideways glances. It was strange; although he still desired Betty at least as much as he had the previous night, he was almost glad they hadn't slept together. They'd both been completely overtired and drunk to boot, so despite the amped-up mood, it probably would have ended in disappointment. At the very least, it certainly wouldn't have been a mind-blowing experience. This way, however, they still had the first time ahead of them. Michael was convinced that it would come to that. He didn't believe that Betty had only wanted to go to bed with him out of the mood of the moment, which had been additionally fueled by the alcohol, and had regretted it afterwards. And if it were so, it was all the more good that they had not done it.
